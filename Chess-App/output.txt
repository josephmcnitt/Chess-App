FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 2 7; Commentary: A battle for tempo. White doesn't want to develop his lightsquared bishop before Black takes on c4, as he would lose a tempo in theproces.

FEN: r3r3/1b1p1pkp/p4q2/1p2Q3/5P2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R4R1K w - - 5 22; Commentary: But this is a serious mistake, which putsBlack on the verge of defeat. His king is weaker and he should definitelyexchange queens here
FEN: r3r3/1b1p1pkp/p4q2/1p5Q/5P2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R4R1K b - - 6 22; Commentary: Now White gets to keep the queens on the board andalso snatches the d7 pawn

FEN: 8/6k1/8/7P/1p4K1/8/P7/8 w - - 1 60; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And here finally a draw was agreed. A very tense, interesting andinstructive clash, with mass of interesting variations. Both players displayedgreat resourcefulness and tenacity and the draw seems like a fair result.  This game was christened as "An Immortal Draw."
FEN: rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4; Commentary: [pgndiagram] In the 30s, strong players havestarted recognizing various Indian openings as a playable options. Alekhine,who was always open to new ideas (remember that he introduced the defence 1 e4Nf6) refrains from the "boring" Queen's gambit this time.

FEN: 8/5rp1/7p/4kP1P/6K1/1N4P1/8/8 w - - 5 58; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And finally Vidmar resigned. A very typical Alekhine game -tactical combination flowing from a strategicaly superior position and leadinginto a better endgame. The conversion was not that smooth these time, butVidmar was unable to endure the tension and cracked under the pressure, likemany of Alekhine's opponents before (and after) him.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Budapest Gambit! A tricky, but objectivelydubious opening, played often on the lower levels and in blitz games, withdecent results

FEN: r1b1kb1r/ppppqp1p/6p1/2n5/2P5/5PP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10; Commentary: A fantastic, counterintuitivemove. If White takes with the Bishop, Black can exploit the semi-open e-fileto put some pressure on the pawn. White removes the potential weakness, opensthe file for his own use, and realizes that his strong central presence morethan compensates for the doubled pawn

FEN: r4rk1/ppp2pp1/2bpq3/6PR/3Qn3/5N2/PPP2PP1/2KR4 w - - 2 15; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And here comes a decisive mistake of the game

FEN: r4rk1/ppp3p1/2bpq3/4NpPR/3Qn3/8/PPP2PP1/2K4R b - - 1 16; Commentary: This great move,diverting the queen or the pawn, is the main reason why this, not particularlyoutstanding game is given here. To find a combination like this, in simul inparticular, is typicaly Alekhinesque

But the way he uses that tempo (g2-g3) could have turned tohis disadvantage' - Alekhine.  Even so, Bent Larsen played this move order 30years later and obtained decent results

But imho, this isslightly biased toward Alekhine. He was pramgatic enough to realize that he isrisking much more in this position

FEN: 6k1/p6p/1p2PQ2/3p3p/2pP4/qnP5/6PP/6K1 w - - 1 34; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now only precision is required from White. Note how helplessthe knight on b3 is.
FEN: 6k1/p3P2p/1p3Q2/3p3p/2pP4/qnP5/6PP/6K1 b - - 0 34; Commentary: Sufficient. There were other winning moves, butBotvinnik has calculated his king can hide from the annoying checks.
FEN: 6k1/p3P2p/1p3Q2/3p3K/2pP2P1/1nP5/7P/4q3 b - - 2 41; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A fantastic victory by Botvinnik over Capablanca and asymbolic end of the era of classical chess titans.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The SemiTarrasch defence has been regarded as an inferior defence for a long time, butit has been revived in the 21st century. But old masters didn't care all thatmuch about the opening verdicts back then - Botvinnik was the very firstplayer who started studying opening scientifically.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pn4/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7; Commentary: "A specifically prepared novelty." - Kasparov

FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1p3/3n4/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11; Commentary: This seemingly natural moveturns out to be a serious mistake. Black weakens his knight on c6 and Whiteimmediately exploits it.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1p3/3N4/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Typical Botvinnik- when an opportunity for concrete play appears, he exploits it.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn5/3p4/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 12; Commentary: Now Black has an isolani of his own and white is able to generateimmediate play against Black's queenside

FEN: 1n3rk1/r4ppp/pp1q4/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPQ2PPP/2R1R1K1 b - - 3 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Botvinnik's commentis very instructive here: "The c-file is more important than the e-file, sincein the future the e7-square can be defended by the king, whereas the c7-squareremains vulnerable."
FEN: 1n3rk1/2R2ppp/pp6/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 22; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Oneof those endgames where White doesn't have a material advantage, but thedifference in placement of the pieces is more than enough to play for a win
FEN: 1n3rk1/2R3pp/pp3p2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/6K1 w - - 0 23; Commentary: Alekhine defends tenaciously. This move prepares Rf7 and the eviction ofWhite's rook from the 7th rank. This move also prevents the knight jump to e5
FEN: 1n3rk1/7p/pp3p2/3p2p1/3P4/2R2N2/PP3PPP/5K2 w - - 0 26; Commentary: Gaining some space on the kingside and removing the pawnsfrom the 7th rank. This move is double edges as it creates yet anotherweakening

FEN: 1n3rk1/8/pp3p2/3p2pp/3P3P/2R5/PP3PP1/4NK2 b - - 0 27; Commentary: [pgndiagram] I will be honest, when I first saw this game, icompletely failed to understand this move. Why does Kasparov attach twoexclamation marks to a move that simply drops a pawn? Why is this move sogood?   The reply is obvious - White simply fix the weakness and h5.
FEN: 6k1/2Rn1r2/pp3p2/3p2pp/3P3P/5N2/PP3PP1/5K2 b - - 4 29; Commentary: Forcing g4, removing the defender of the f4 square
FEN: 6k1/2Rn1r2/pp6/3p3p/3P1ppP/3N1P2/PP4P1/5K2 b - - 0 32; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Another instructive moment - Botvinnikprevents the further advance of the f-pawn. The number of weaknesses increasesonce again
FEN: 6k1/2Rn1r2/1p6/p2p3p/P2P1p1P/3N1P2/1P6/5K2 b - - 0 34; Commentary: Major material gains are not far away
FEN: 1n1k4/8/1pR5/p2p1r1p/P2P1p1P/1P1N1P2/4K3/8 w - - 3 39; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Desperation. Black is willing to giveup a pawn for some activity.

FEN: 1k6/6R1/np3r2/p2N3p/P2P1p1P/1P3P2/4K3/8 b - - 0 44; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Finally, the d5 pawn falls and the rest is matter oftechnique
FEN: 8/2k5/1p6/1R6/P2P1p1r/1P1K1P2/8/8 b - - 1 51; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A fantastic strategical masterpiece byBotvinnik. One of those highly instructive games of the sixth world champion
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A rather rare move. Usually in these positions, White delays thedevelopment of this bishop and waits for Black to capture on c4 instead. Theso called "struggle for tempo" is highly typical of the Queens' gambit declined
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8; Commentary: Entering the position with anisolated pawn. Back in 1936, almost everyone thought Black is automaticallybetter in these positions; Botvinnik was the first to prove White's dynamicresources are force to be reckoned with.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram]"Positions with an isolated d4-pawn were a 'hobby horse' of Botvinnik, whodiscolosed virtually all their resources! Previously many masters, onobtaining an 'isolani' in the centre, experienced an almost mystical fear -apparently under the influence of Steinitz's impressive wins over Zukertortand the powerful logical arguments of the first world champion, who spoke outagainst the creation of unnecessary weaknesses in the position. But Botvinnikdemonstrated that the activity of the pieces and the pressure in the centremore than compensate for the insignificant defect in the pawn structure. " -Kasparov
FEN: r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/4pn2/3n2B1/3P4/1BNQ1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 13; Commentary: This occupation of the d5square is made automatically even today, but it is not the most precise.
FEN: r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2b1pn2/3nN1B1/3P4/1BNQ4/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 8 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Black's position is slightly overcrowded

FEN: r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3nN1B1/3P1P2/1B5Q/PP4PP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: Botvinnik's patent advance of the f-pawn, which has become classic eversince.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3nNPB1/3P4/1B5Q/PP4PP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 18; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Like a battering ram, the pawn shattersBlack's pawn structure. All White's pieces are placed ideally
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/3nNRB1/3P4/1B5Q/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: Now White has manytactical threats, connected with the pin on the b3-g8 diagonal

FEN: 2r2rk1/pp2bNpp/3q1n2/3n1RB1/3P4/1B5Q/PP4PP/3R2K1 b - - 0 20; Commentary: [pgndiagram] An elegant blow in awinning position. This wins material

FEN: rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: [pgndiagram] From the English opening,the game has tranpsposed to the Nimzo-Indian defence. Botvinnik choses therisky Sämisch Variation, that is currently not any more popular.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1b5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Thepoint. Black voluntarily gives up his dark squared bishop in order to doublethe pawns on the c-file.
FEN: rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1P2P2/4P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: Also quite logical. White intendsto occupy the center and intends to play on the kingisde.
FEN: rn1qk2r/p1p2ppp/bp2pn2/3p4/2PPP3/P1P2P2/6PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This move was severely criticized by all the commentators. Byadvancing his d-pawn, Black allows White to rid himself of the weak c4 pawn.Loss of castling is small price for that
FEN: rn1qk2r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/3PP3/P1P2P2/6PP/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now White has simply gained a compact pawn structure in thecenter for nothing
FEN: rn1qk2r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p2B1/3PP3/P1P2P2/6PP/R2Q1KNR b kq - 1 10; Commentary: This was a novelty at a time. The primitivee-pawn advance still seems more logical
FEN: rn1qk2r/p4pp1/1pp2n1p/8/Q2Pp2B/P1P2P2/6PP/R4KNR w kq - 0 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Botvinnik was terribly critical of this move. "A highly dubiousdecision. The opening of lines in the center merely assists the development ofWhite's initiative."   But I think this comment was influenced by the resultof the game - Black's position is not yet worse.
FEN: rn1qk2r/p4p2/1pp2n1p/6p1/Q2Pp2B/P1P2P2/6PP/4RKNR w kq - 0 14; Commentary: Kasparovcomments this was forced, but the engine is more creative
FEN: rn2k2r/p3qp2/1pp2n1p/6p1/Q2Pp3/P1P2P2/5BPP/4RKNR w kq - 2 15; Commentary: It is not clearwhether Black should put the queen in the way of the rook
FEN: rn2k2r/p3qp2/1pp2n1p/6p1/Q2Pp3/P1P2P2/4NBPP/4RK1R b kq - 3 15; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Great strategical decision. The knight is aiming for g3 assoon as possible, in order to eye the e4 and f5 squares
FEN: rn2k2r/p4p2/2p2n1p/1p4p1/3Pp2P/q1P2P2/2Q1NBP1/4RK1R b kq - 0 17; Commentary: Another very strong move, undermining the kingside structure

FEN: 2r5/R7/2p2p1p/1kB5/R2Pr3/2p5/5KP1/8 b - - 3 33; Commentary: [pgndiagram] With theunavoidable Rb4 checkmate. A fantastic game by Botvinnik and one of the bestexamples why his contemporaries described him as a bulldozer.

FEN: r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/1nn1b3/4p3/8/P1NP1NP1/1P2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9; Commentary: The main move even today- White's idea is to expand on the queenside and utilize the c5 square
FEN: r2qk2r/1pp1bppp/1nn1b3/p3p3/8/P1NP1NP1/1P2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10; Commentary: Perhaps Black should wait with this move untilWhite has played b4 himself.   "Nowadays, this is considered to be weakening."- Kasparov

FEN: rn1qrbk1/1pp2ppp/8/p2bp3/Q7/P2PBNP1/1PR1PPBP/2R3K1 w - - 7 16; Commentary: But this is a mistake. Portisch thoughtc7 pawn is immune, and intended to continue with c6. However, he was in for anunpleasant surprise
FEN: rn1qrbk1/1pR2ppp/2R5/p3p3/Q7/P2PBNP1/1P2PPBP/6K1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A bolt from theblue. This looks like desperation, but in reality, White plays a deadlycombination, with the sacrifice of both rooks
FEN: rn1qrbk1/5Rpp/2p5/p3p3/Q7/P2PBNP1/1P2PPBP/6K1 b - - 0 18; Commentary: [pgndiagram]A fantastic combination. As it turns out, the second rook can't be accepted

Under theinfluence of this game, 4...Bc5 was considered dangerous for Black, but in therecent years strong grandmasters like Peter Svidler managed to prove that 5Nxe5 is sort of a "drawing combination" - Black should be perfectly fine.

The problem is he can't take on d5, as his knight on e6 willget hit, and it doesn't have a good square. Compare this to a previousvariation where the knight from e6 jumped to d4.

Once the queen takes the rook (ormoves anywhere, for that matter), White takes on h4 and checkmates. In myopinion a brilliant game, displaying Botvinnik's best characteristics -consistent implementation of a strategical plan followed up by a decisivetactical combo.

White avoids the Ba4 threat and moves hisrook to a1(!) in anticipation of the opening of the a-file
FEN: r2qrbk1/5p1n/1n4pp/p2pP3/bppP1P2/P5NB/1P2NBPP/RQ3RK1 b - - 4 24; Commentary: Another brilliant strategical move. The queen is maintained on the b1-h7diagonal, keeping the f5 square under control

It is amazing that Gazza's ideasare topical well after his retirement. Pushing flank pawns was always afavourite idea of his.   This move is objectively not the strongest , butblack has to play precisely. It's clear that this position Aronian had on hisboard at some point while preparing for the game since this move was playedinstantly.

It's movingking from e1 do a5 diagonal stoping the potencial check after Qc3, defendingpawn on g2 and moving the king from centre.

FEN: 1r2b1k1/6pp/4p3/3nN2P/pp4P1/1P6/PB3PK1/2R5 b - - 0 31; Commentary: Now White gains evenmore space on the kingside and restricts Black's bishop
FEN: r3bk2/6pp/4p3/2RnN2P/pp1B2P1/1P3PK1/P7/8 b - - 0 40; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Theposition is still highly unpleasant for Ding. White has more active pieces,better structure and the pressure is mounting.
FEN: r3b3/4k1pp/4p3/2RnN2P/pp1B2PK/1P3P2/P7/8 b - - 2 41; Commentary: Intending toprovoke h6 in the future, though it is not clear whether White should do that

FEN: 8/5bpk/2n4p/4p2P/1p3PP1/1P1N2K1/rB6/4R3 w - - 0 53; Commentary: This trade seems favourable for Black - he gets rid ofone weakness and creates a passed pawn of his own

Caruana hasbeen incredibly consistent throughout the event, but in the next round hefaces Mamedyarov with Black and he might regret dearly the chances he missedin this one

FEN: 3r1k1r/1bq1bpp1/p3p2n/1p1PP2p/2p5/PnN1BN1P/1P2QPP1/1B1RR1K1 b - - 0 22; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This shows how chessis sometimes simple. White's pieces are perfectly placed and the most logicalthing is to open centre and attack black king.

FEN: 2r3kr/3q2p1/pB3bBn/1p1b3p/2p2N2/Pn5P/1P2QPP1/3RR1K1 b - - 1 29; Commentary: It was quite surprising thatDing missed both Nd8 and Rd5. They aren't too complicated compared to manyvariants in this game. Probably the combination of nerves and not havingenough time got better of him. Even after this move, white is still muchbetter.
FEN: 2r3kr/3q2p1/pB3bBn/1p1b3p/2p2N2/P6P/1P2QPP1/2nRR1K1 w - - 2 30; Commentary: It's alwaysinteresting to see Grischuk play on 30 seconds. According to many topGrandmaster's he's still making best moves although he has little or no time.Unsurprisingly he has won World Blitz Championship 3 times ( 2006, 2012 and2015 ).

FEN: 7k/5np1/p1r2b2/1p2n3/2pB4/P7/1PB3PK/3RR3 w - - 2 42; Commentary: Weird and weak move. Blackpieces are weaker than white's. Why would you give strong bishop for "double"night?
FEN: 6k1/6p1/p3rb2/1p1Rn3/2p5/PP5K/2B3P1/4R3 b - - 0 45; Commentary: It's in black's favor toexchange as many pawns as possible. I can't find the reason why white wouldplay this.
FEN: 8/4b1p1/R3k3/1p6/8/n6K/2B3P1/8 b - - 0 50; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now it's clear that this position isn't winning for whiteany more. White still has some winning chances but objectively the position isdraw.
FEN: 8/5KP1/8/5n2/8/8/2k5/8 w - - 1 97; Commentary: Crazy game ! Watching it was like being on a roller coaster ride. Ding canreally be sad that he didn't win this one but I think he'll have anopportunity to learn quite a lot from this game specially from thepsychological aspect. Grischuk can be happy he miraculosly saved this game andstill has good chances for the first 3 places.

FEN: 2kr2r1/pp1qbpp1/7p/2pB4/5Pb1/P1P1B3/1PPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 0 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A staggering decision -White gives up an exchange for the pawn and the strong d5 bishop. Karjakinsaid he wasn't sure about the consequences, but decided to go so nevertheless.Putin's Minister of Defence proves he has nerves of steel.  Or balls.

A fantastic game by Sergey, which put him in the lead two roundsbefore the end. Moreover, at this point, he had better tiebreaks than Caruana,so in the event of them sharing the lead, he would be proclaimed as a winner. Last two rounds will be once again incredibly dramatic and we can only thankFIDE they decided to supplement knock-out matches with a Candidates tournament.

It is interesting he decided to go 1 e4, but hewas probably aware Aronian doesn't play the Berlin, but rather the Marshall

But kudos to Caruana for bravery; after finding himself in adesperate situation, he managed to win 'to order' and now the pressure is onKarjakin who has the White pieces tomorrow. In any case, an extremelyinteresting final round awaits us tomorrow.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3; Commentary: A somewhat surprising, but perfectly logical decision,considering the tournament situation. In contrast to the last round of theprevious Candidates Tournament where he played the Rauzer Sicilain, Caruanaopts for safety first and sticks to his guns. He decides to keep the game insafe waters and to see how the remaining games are going to unfold with a drawin his pocket.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: For the first time in the tournament he has to facethis continuation. Previously, everyone took on e5
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pP3/8/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] I highly doubt this is the critical way ofbattling the Petroff, but then again, everything is playable these days
FEN: r3k2r/pp1qbppp/2n5/2ppP3/6b1/2PB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq - 5 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Okay, it is time to take thestop and consider the situation arising out of the opening. White has a pawnmajority on the kingside, which he would very much like to advance, but it isvery hard to achieve. His pawn on e5 gives him more space, but also needs someprotection. Black on the other hand, can consider playing on the queenside,undermining the structure with a timely f6 or advancing the center with d4. Itis hard to say whether anyone is better, but the position is not an automaticdraw
FEN: r3k2r/pp1qbppp/2n5/2ppP2b/5B2/2PB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QR1K1 b kq - 2 12; Commentary: Overprotecting the e5 pawn. Nimzowitsch would beproud

FEN: r4rk1/p3b1p1/1pn1p2p/3pP3/1Pp5/P1PB2BP/5PP1/3RR1K1 w - - 0 19; Commentary: A good move,closing the queenside
FEN: r2r2k1/8/p1nBp2p/1p1pP1p1/PPp5/2P2PbP/2B1R1P1/3R2K1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is instructive how the maneouvre of the bishop to g3 incombination with g5 restricted White's kingside majority.
FEN: 2rr4/5k2/p1nBp2p/1p1pP1p1/PPp5/2P2PbP/4R1P1/RB3K2 b - - 9 30; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The start of the wrongpath. Objectively, if both sides keep shuffling, neither play can count on anyadvantage

FEN: 2r5/3r1k2/2nBp2p/1p2P1p1/1Pp1B3/R4PbP/R5P1/5K2 b - - 3 35; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now e5 falls all the same, but at least White has managed toactivate a bit
FEN: 2r5/R4k2/4p2p/1B2b1p1/1Pp5/4KP1P/R5P1/1r6 b - - 6 40; Commentary: [pgndiagram] At this point, Caruanasaid he knew he was better, but not certain whether it was enough for win. Iam not sure, but I think Mamedyarov's game had already finished (or finishedvery soon) so Caruana could basically offer a draw at any moment. Instead, hekept on playing for the win - a brave and courageous decision, displaying hischaracter traits. Kudos!
FEN: 2r5/3R4/4pk1p/6p1/1r2Bb2/2p2P1P/2R1K1P1/8 b - - 3 46; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Practically speaking, it is incrediblydifficult to defend this position as White. Moreover, he has zero counterplay,which makes Caruana's decision to continue much more understandable.
FEN: 2R5/8/4p3/4k1p1/1r2B2p/2p2P1P/2RbK1P1/r7 b - - 19 58; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Finally, Grischuk cracks under the pressure and commits a decisive mistake

At 25 years of age, Caruana finally managed to getthrough to the Candidates. Judging by the play in the tournament, he hascompletely deserved the shot at the title and I believe he will be definitelya worthy challenger.

FEN: 6k1/2R3P1/1pKP4/8/r7/8/8/8 b - - 0 52; Commentary: [pgndiagram] One of the most instructive endgames everplayed.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Some strange sort ofPhilidor /Four knights game is on the board.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5; Commentary: And now Capa transposesto Ruy Lopez. Don't ask me what is the name of variation, I am really confusedwith the move order :D.  Probably some sort of Berlin/Steinitz defence with d6
FEN: r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 7; Commentary: Black is typicaly passive, but rather solid in this positions.He doesn't have immediate problems with development or many weaknesses, but hedoes have less space.
FEN: r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np1n2/1B6/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 8; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Exchanging the pieces is usually in favour of player with lessspace.
FEN: r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/1N6/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] White is stillslightly better in this type of pawn structure, where White's e4 pawn facesBlack's d6 counterpart.   However, an exchange of two pairs of minor pieces isdefinitely to Black's advantage. Typicaly White has attacking chances on thekingside in similar positions and exchanges reduce his attacking potential
FEN: r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/1N6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 2 11; Commentary: This move is slightly pointless

FEN: r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 12; Commentary: NowWhite's knight will feel very good on f5, hitting Black's d6 pawn and creatingthreats on the kingside

FEN: 5rk1/ppq2ppp/2p2b2/4BN2/4P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/3rR1K1 w - - 1 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The problems prove to be too difficult for Fonaroff and hecommits a decisive mistake of the game
FEN: 5rk1/ppq2ppp/2p5/4bN2/4P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Now Capablanca finishes the game with an eleganttactical sequence, exploiting the weakness of the back rank and theunfortunate position of the piece on e5

Avery attractive game by Capablanca, even if the class of the opponent was notvery high. The combination immediately became classic.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The Colle system. Harmless, but at thesame time also very dangerous system for Black.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: This particularvariation, featuring an early b3, is topical even today. Hell, it was evenplayed in the 11th game of the Carlsen - Karjakin World Championship match.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: But this is already a rare response. Black locks his light squared bishop
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/1P3N2/PBPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: Still, Black hasn't done anything wrong so farand has a perfectly playable position
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbp3/3p3n/3P4/1P1B1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 10; Commentary: But thisis already slightly misguided. Black embarks on kingside activity instead ofcompleting his development calmly
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2nbp3/3p1p1n/3P4/1P1B1NP1/PBPN1P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Once you have said A,you usually say B. But here Black should have admitted his mistake andretreated his knight
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2nbp3/3pNp1n/3P4/1P1B2P1/PBPN1P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11; Commentary: Apart from exploiting the weaknessof e5, White could have also opened things up with c4
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2nbpn2/3pNp2/3P1P2/1P1B2P1/PBPN3P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12; Commentary: And this move is hard tojudge. On one hand it strengthens White's control of e5, but on the other handit hands the e4 square to Black
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2n1pn2/3pbp2/3P1P2/1P1B2P1/PBPN3P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13; Commentary: But this is a serious error. Although the pawn on e5 shieldsBlack's weak e6 pawn, this exchange increases White's control of space.
FEN: r4r1k/pp1b1n1p/1qn1p3/3pPpp1/3P4/PP1B1NPP/1BP2QK1/R4R2 w - - 0 20; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Thisdecision is also objectively dubious. An ancient chess rule claims that it isbetter not to play on the side of the board where your opponent has theadvantage. But on the other hand Black is desperate for counterplay in thisposition
FEN: r4r1k/pp1b1n1p/1qn1p3/3pPpp1/3P2P1/PP1B1N1P/1BP2QK1/R4R2 b - - 0 20; Commentary: I like this decision by Capablanca

FEN: r5rk/pp1b1n1p/1q6/3pPpp1/3P4/PP1Q1N1P/1BP4K/4RR2 w - - 0 26; Commentary: [pgndiagram] So far Black has played verywell in the complications and managed to outplay Capablanca who missed someimportant tactical nuances (Kasparov speculated that this tendency of beingsuperfluous was to cost him dearly in later stages of his career)
FEN: r5rk/pp1b1n1p/1q6/3pPpp1/2PP4/PP1Q1N1P/1B5K/4RR2 b - - 0 26; Commentary: On the outside, White's pawn mass looks extremely threatening, but Black hasstrong countermeasures available
FEN: r5rk/pp1b1n1p/4q3/3pPpp1/2PP4/PP1Q1N1P/1B5K/4RR2 w - - 1 27; Commentary: This, unfortunately for Corzo, isnot one of them. The text move prepares Bb5 in the future, but Corzo overlooksthe possibility of a queen sacrifice
FEN: r5rk/pp1b1n1p/4P3/3q1pp1/3P4/PP1Q1N1P/1B5K/4RR2 b - - 0 28; Commentary: [pgndiagram]After this, White is winning. But Capa does it in a spectacular fashion
FEN: r5rk/pp3n1p/4P3/1b1q1pp1/3P4/PP1Q1N1P/1B5K/4RR2 w - - 1 29; Commentary: Probably Corzo was counting on this move, but this is met by a spectacularriposte, which is the main reason why this game is included in this collection
FEN: r5rk/pp3n1p/4P3/1Q1q1pp1/3P4/PP3N1P/1B5K/4RR2 b - - 0 29; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A fantastic sacrifice, although strictly speaking, it was not 100% necessary
FEN: r6k/pp3Prp/8/1q1P1pp1/8/PP3N1P/1B5K/4RR2 b - - 0 31; Commentary: White has obtained only two pieces for the queen.But his pawn on f7 is a monster, and the pin via g7 is extremely annoying
FEN: r6k/pp3Pr1/7p/1q1P1pp1/3N4/PP5P/1B5K/4RR2 b - - 1 32; Commentary: not the strongest move actually, as it allows Black to continueresisting for some time now
FEN: r6k/pp3Pr1/7p/3P1pp1/3N4/PP5P/1B5K/4Rq2 w - - 0 33; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The best chance. Blackexploits the fact that for the moment rook on g7 is not pinned, and sacrificeshis queen. Unfortunately for him, he still ends up in a losing engame
FEN: r6k/pp3r2/7p/3P1Rp1/3N4/PP5P/1B5K/8 b - - 0 34; Commentary: Now Capa needs to display his technique, which is not a problemfor him in this position. The game is essentialy over
FEN: 5r2/pp1PN3/7k/4B3/6p1/PP6/6K1/8 b - - 0 41; Commentary: [pgndiagram] For the moment it seems tha Capa has overextended
FEN: 3r2N1/pp1P4/7k/4B3/6p1/PP6/6K1/8 b - - 2 42; Commentary: But this cheeky move allows him to enter an endgame where he will bea clear piece up
FEN: 3B4/pp6/6k1/8/6p1/PP6/6K1/8 b - - 0 45; Commentary: Corzo could have easily resigned here
FEN: 8/8/k7/1pK5/pP6/P7/6pB/8 b - - 5 60; Commentary: One of those games that demonstrated Capablanca'sresourcefullness in objectively worse positions and which shows that Capacould have played as energetically and riskily as for instance Lasker andAlekhine.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The Tarrasch! Capa wasn't afraid ofthe isolated pawn back in the day

FEN: r3k2r/pp2qppp/4b3/2ppN3/3nn3/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12; Commentary: A cold shower. Capa simplifies the position
FEN: r3k2r/pp2qppp/4b3/2p1N3/4p3/4PnP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 14; Commentary: Another good decision. Capa decides to give up a pawn on e4 in this way, andas a result he will have a 3-2 pawn majority on the queenside
FEN: r4rk1/pp2qppp/4b3/2p5/8/4PQP1/PP3PBP/R4RK1 w - - 1 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is time to pause for a moment. The position should be deadequal; with the great number of the pieces on the board, the pawn majority ofthe queenside shouldn't be regarded as an advantage per se. However, under theinfluence of this games, for quite some time it has been regarded thatqueenside pawn majority brings automatic advantage
FEN: 1r3rk1/ppq2ppp/4b3/2p5/4Q3/4P1P1/PP3PBP/R1R3K1 w - - 5 18; Commentary: Capa intends to push his pawns

FEN: 3r2k1/p4p1p/4b1p1/1p6/2p1q3/P1R1PBP1/1P3P1P/6K1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: Now, after queen exchange, b5 will not beattacked, so Black should go for the exchange
FEN: 6k1/5p1p/4b1p1/pp6/2p1B3/P1R1P1P1/1P3PKP/3r4 w - - 0 28; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The game is almost over; Black's queenside pawn majority willsoon come crashing through. It is amazing how quickly Marshall, a top 10player, lost his way in a seemingly harmless position
FEN: 6k1/5p1p/4b1p1/8/8/2P1P1P1/1R3PKP/3r4 w - - 0 36; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Capa wins the piece and with itthe game. Marshall could have resigned here, but back in the day resigningwasn't done as easily as today
FEN: 8/6k1/3R2p1/5p2/5P1K/2P1r3/6b1/8 w - - 8 50; Commentary: [pgndiagram] An impressivegame, which had a massive influence on many subsequent generations of thechess players.

FEN: 7k/p5p1/2PRn3/1p3p2/8/2P2P2/P3q1KP/7R w - - 5 31; Commentary: [pgndiagram] An impressive,effortless victory and the best example of the validity of  "Never play King'sgambit against Capablanca" saying
FEN: rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: A strange way of playing the Queen'sgambit, with the dark squared bishop locked behind the pawn chain
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: This time there is no Tarrasch. Capablanca plays moreclassicaly
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5; Commentary: I don't like this move. White refrains from Nc3, puttingsome pressure on the d5 pawn, and allows Black to carry out his own c5 advanceeasily
FEN: rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Prettythematic in similar positions and a good move, putting immediate pressure onthe White centre.

FEN: r2r2k1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2b5/8/P2nP3/1P2QPPP/R1B1NRK1 b - - 2 18; Commentary: It is natural that White wants to get rid of the knightimmediately, but this delays his development further and gives Black more timeto create some attacking chances
FEN: 2rr2k1/p4ppp/1p2pq2/2b5/8/P3P3/1P2QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 20; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It isapparent that Black's pieces are much more active and that he has the upperhand

FEN: 4R3/5ppk/1p3b2/3q3p/1P6/4P1B1/5R1K/8 w - - 7 42; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Here Aaron finally decided to throw in the towel. A brilliantgame by Capablanca - healthy logical play in the opening, setting the opponentwith some problems in the middlegame and exploiting his mistakes in a tacticalmanner when required. He was always a difficult opponent for Nimzowitsch.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: This is a game from the later stage of Capablanca's career, with thepeak of his chess strength long gone. However, he was still capable ofproducing masterpieces reminiscent of his best days. Masterpieces such as thisone

FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is interesting to note that Capablanca puts his knight on e7instead of f6. He is already intending to place his king on the kingside andpush the kingside pawns and he doesn't want his knight on the way of the f-pawn

FEN: 2k1r3/ppp3p1/2nb1p2/3p2N1/3P1nPp/2P1B3/PP3PP1/R4NK1 w - - 0 21; Commentary: Capablanca plays this stage very strongly in myopinion. First he makes sure he doesn't lose his f-pawn

FEN: 8/p1nk4/1p3p2/2pp2p1/P2P1bPp/1PP2P2/4K1P1/3N1N2 b - - 2 33; Commentary: Faulty. White probably missed the tactical shotBlack has at his disposal

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: It is interesting to observe that Capablanca even took up theSicilian in his later years.

The most prominent  case was the Karjakin -Caruana Candidates 2016 final round clash (the famous rook sacrifice game).
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6; Commentary: Nowadays Bg5 is regarded as the main answer

FEN: 1r3rk1/2qbbppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4PP2/1N2BBN1/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b - - 7 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Still, this knight does very little onthis square and Black has a very good Sicilian

FEN: 1rr3k1/2qbbppp/2nppn2/1p6/p2NPP2/4BBN1/PPPQ2PP/4RRK1 w - - 2 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Somehow, quietly,Capablanca creates a model Sicilian game. True, Lasker's treatment of theposition is not particularly impressive, but Capa, thanks to his incredibletalent, somehow understands what he needs to do without having a vast Sicilianexperience
FEN: 1rr3k1/2qbbppp/2nppn2/1p6/p2NPP2/4BBN1/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 b - - 3 17; Commentary: Another passive move, defending the c2 pawn
FEN: 1rr1n1k1/2qbbppp/2npp3/1p6/p2NPP2/4BBN1/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 w - - 4 18; Commentary: [pgndiagram] So far Capablanca has played excellently, but here he startsbeing too cautious
FEN: 1rr1n1k1/2q1bppp/2bpp3/1p3P2/p3P3/4BBN1/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: Now with the knigh on e8, things aren't as simple
FEN: 1rr1n1k1/1q2bppp/2bp4/1p2pP1N/p3P3/4BB2/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 w - - 2 21; Commentary: Increasing pressure on e4,which has been weakened by the departure of the g3 knight
FEN: 1rr1n1k1/1q2b1pp/2bp1p2/1p2pPBN/p3P3/5B2/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 22; Commentary: Agood decision, preventing the creation of attacking chances on the kingside.It is not that hard to carry the d5 advance out, after which seemingly deadbishop will breathe once again
FEN: 1rr3k1/1qn1b1pp/2bp1p2/1p2pP1N/p3P3/4BB2/PPPQ1RPP/4R1K1 w - - 2 23; Commentary: Another piece controls the d5 square

FEN: 2rr3k/1qn1b1pp/2bp1p2/1p2pP1N/p3P3/P3BB2/1PPR2PP/3QR1K1 w - - 1 26; Commentary: Again refraining from d5,which would have been very strong once again
FEN: 2rr3k/1qn1b1pp/2b2p2/1p1ppP1N/p3P3/P4B2/1PPR1BPP/3QR1K1 w - - 0 27; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Finally, this advance comes. But the fact that White has played a3 and Bf2 hasreduced the effect of this push. Somewhat
FEN: 2rr3k/1q2b1pp/2b2p2/1p1BpP1N/p7/P7/1PPR1BPP/3QR1K1 b - - 0 28; Commentary: But thisis the losing decision. Giving up the bishop pair in this position is just aterrible decision
FEN: 2r4k/1q2b1pp/2b2p2/1p1rpP1N/p5Q1/P7/1PPR1BPP/4R1K1 b - - 1 29; Commentary: I am not sure whether Laskersimply acted out of desperation, or overestimated the power of the matingthreat
FEN: 3r3k/1q4pp/2b2p2/1p1rpP1N/p5Q1/P7/1PPR1KPP/3R4 w - - 1 32; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Capablanca couldhave extracted more after Lasker's unfortunate decision, but even so, heretains the superior position. The knight on h5 is once again the main reasonfor that (Am I starting to repeat myself too often?)
FEN: 7k/1q4pp/5p2/1p1bpP1N/pQ6/P7/1PP2KPP/8 b - - 1 34; Commentary: Just as he came close to equalizing, Lasker suddenly makes anactive move that turns out to be a decisive mistake. His king gets chased intoopen
FEN: q6k/6pp/5p2/1p2pP1N/pQb5/P4K2/1PP3PP/8 w - - 6 37; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Not the best .
FEN: 3q3k/6pp/5p2/1p2pP1N/pQb5/P7/1PP2KPP/8 w - - 8 38; Commentary: Now White has some defensivechances, but he needs to find a series of very precise moves, which turns outto be impossible task even for the great Emanuel
FEN: 7k/6pp/5p2/1p2pP1N/p1b5/P1Q5/1PP2KPP/3q4 w - - 10 39; Commentary: Capablanca immediately takes the opportunity to activatethe Queen and gains a tempo along the way
FEN: 7k/6p1/5p1p/1p2pP2/p1b5/P1Q3N1/1PP2KPP/3q4 w - - 0 40; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Anotherstrong move. Capa creates some space for his king and gets rid of the backrank issues once and for all

FEN: 8/6pk/5p1p/P3p3/2p5/Q7/5q2/2K5 w - - 4 55; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Here Lasker finally resigned. The a pawn advance is countered
FEN: Q7/6pk/5p1p/8/4p3/Q7/2pq4/1K6 w - - 0 59; Commentary: And White will soon get mated
FEN: r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Nowadays, this continuation hasbeen pretty much overshadowed by the infamous Berlin endgame starting with 3...Nf6.   But the text move is very much playable; the recent Carlsen - KarjakinWorld Championship match saw the defending champion using it on a regularbasis.
FEN: r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 9; Commentary: With this move Black chooses to play the so-called Chigorin variation ofthe Ruy Lopez.
FEN: r3k2r/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP1b1/2P2N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 3 12; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But thismove is not the best. Usually this move puts pressure on the d4 pawn, but hereWhite can simply close the center and the text move loses its point somewhat
FEN: r3k2r/2q1bp1p/p2p1n2/nppPp1p1/4P1b1/2P2N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 13; Commentary: And this agression isjust plain bad, that shows that the level of understanding of similar RuyLopez positions was very low at the time.   It is not possible for Black tocreate an attack and this move simply creates a weakness on the kingside.Usually Black castles kingside, but after this lunge he is unable to hide hisking there.
FEN: r3k2r/2q1bp1p/p2p1n2/nppPp1p1/4P1b1/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQRNK1 b kq - 1 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Natural and good.White immediately reroutes his knight toward the weakened f5 square and gainsa tempo by attacking g5 on the way
FEN: 3rk2r/2q1bp2/p2p1n1p/nppPp1p1/4P1b1/2P2NN1/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w k - 2 15; Commentary: I fail tounderstand the purpose of this move

FEN: 3rk2r/2q1bp2/p2p1n1p/n2Pp1p1/Pp2P1b1/3B1NN1/1P3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b k - 1 17; Commentary: Black has to spend an additional move to defend a6

FEN: 2brk2r/2q1bp2/p2p3p/n2Pp1p1/Pp2P1n1/3BBNN1/1P3PPP/2RQR1K1 b k - 5 19; Commentary: Once again, Bd2, not allowing the exchane of the bishop, was thealternative
FEN: 1qbrk2r/4bp2/p2p3p/n2Pp1p1/Pp2P1n1/3BBNN1/1P3PPP/2RQR1K1 w k - 6 20; Commentary: Black shouldhave taken the opportunity and exchanged White's bishop
FEN: 1qbrk2r/4bp2/p2p3p/n2Pp1p1/Pp2P1n1/3B1NN1/1P1B1PPP/2RQR1K1 b k - 7 20; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Capa refuses to give Yates anotheropportunity
FEN: 3rk2r/3bbp2/2Rp3p/qB1Pp1p1/Pp2P1n1/1n3NN1/1P1BQPPP/4R1K1 b k - 2 24; Commentary: Still, this is a very attractive exchange sacrifice, which would make TigranPetrosian particularly proud.
FEN: 3r1k1r/q4p2/2Bp1b2/3PpNpp/PpN1P1n1/8/1P2QPPP/4R1K1 b - - 3 30; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The positioning and harmony of White's pieces is aestheticallypleasing.
FEN: 3r1k2/5p2/2Bp1b1r/2qPp1pp/PpN1P3/1P2Q3/5PPP/4R1K1 b - - 1 33; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Capablanca once again doesn't hurry,but realizes that Black s unable to disentangle himself and improves theposition of his pieces therefore.
FEN: 2r2k2/5p2/2Bp1b1r/2qPp1pp/PpN1P3/1P2Q3/5PPP/2R3K1 b - - 3 34; Commentary: Again this leaning toward simplicity that Kasparovcriticizes in his books. With this move Capa presents Yates with a realopportunity to get back into the game
FEN: 2rb1k2/5p2/2B4r/2pPN1pp/Pp2P3/1P6/5PPP/2R3K1 b - - 0 36; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Now White wins two additional pawns and his task is much simpler. The soldieron c5 falls as well
FEN: 1b6/4k3/7r/1B1PPppp/Pp6/1P2N3/5PPP/6K1 b - - 2 42; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now the f5 pawn falls as well.
FEN: 1b6/4P2r/5k2/1B1P1Npp/Pp6/1P6/5PPP/6K1 b - - 0 45; Commentary: The question mark is for lazyness; once againwe can observe how Capablanca refuses to calculate variations but simply playsthe "obvious moves"
FEN: 1b6/4k3/8/1B1P2pp/Pp6/1P4P1/5P1P/6K1 b - - 0 47; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Three extra pawns are enough to outweigh the drawishtendencies of the opposite coloured bishops endgame
FEN: 3b4/3P4/5k2/5B2/Pp4KP/1P6/8/8 b - - 0 59; Commentary: The third passed pawn decides theissue
FEN: 8/2bP2k1/8/7P/Pp2B1K1/1P6/8/8 b - - 2 61; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And here Yates finally decided hehas had enough and resigned. All the criticism aside, this is a beautifulpositional game in which Cuban demonstrated deeper understanding of the RuyLopez.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: The Queen's Indian !? In their subsequent matchCapa would only play the Queen's gambit declined.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2pP4/2P5/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: This move is typical of Alekhine's style. He sacrifices a pawn in the openingin order to gain the initiative
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p3n2/2pp4/2P4N/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7; Commentary: This idea would later becomestandard. White exploits the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal and eyes the f5 squarewith his knight.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pb1p1p1p/1p3np1/2pp4/2P4N/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Black probably has to make this move sooneror later

FEN: 8/5pk1/Q2p2p1/8/p1p5/2P5/1K2q3/8 w - - 1 43; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A game in which Capablanca demonstrated superb handling of theBenoni-like position. And you have to bear in mind that his opponent was not"some Yates", but a future challenger and a master of dynamic positions,Alexander Alekhine himself.   Wins such as this reinforced the myth about hisinvulnerability. And indeed, after analyzing a game such as this one it isvery hard to imagine that only a couple of months later Alekhine managed toscore three wins in a short span of 12 games.

FEN: r4rk1/pp2bp1p/4pp2/8/2R5/4PN2/PP3PPP/5RK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Here it is time to takea stop. Most of us would be faster to leave the board at this state thanGolden State Warriors fans are when their team is blowing the 3-1 lead in thefinal. However I think it is very instructive how Karjakin eliminates eventhese slight chances that Magnus had to create some problems. But why shouldMagnus have chances at the first place. Well, White's pawn structure is better,and he is first to seize the open file. However, amount of Black's weaknessesand his good bishop easily deal with that.

Now h pawn can never beattacked by the rook, g pawn is somewhat weakened and stuff. Carlsen admittedthat he planned on going Ne5 and then winning some superior endgame, but as hesaid, "it was a mirage"

By going with the Trompovsky he basically avoided all Karjakin'spreparation and, as on numerous instances before, tried simply to play chess.However, this time, it didn't quite work, but i doubt that Magnus will bedeeply depressed after this game, as he didn't miss serious chances, and hehas another game very soon anyway.

His plan in this position is to play slowly and first develop hispieces, and then eventually go for d4 under more favourable circumstances. Ithink that this approach of controlable agression is dominant in the moderntreatment of the "Queen of openings".

FEN: r2qr1k1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/3PP3/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram]The opening phase is over. White has managed to occupythe centre, but it doesn't bring him much joy. Black's pieces are fullydeveloped and he has simply a pleasant Ruy Lopez position. Maybe whiteshouldn't have hurried with taking the rook back, but played b3 first, toleave the a5 knight stranded, and maybe keep the possibility of doubling onthe a file after a4 somewhere in the future (however far-fetched thisgeneralisation is)

And since Mourinho's teamisn't playing any games today, probability of finding something moreinteresting is considerably high.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/3n4/4R3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1BK1 b - - 0 9; Commentary: [pgndiagram]The tabiya ofthe variation. There are three reasonable moves for Black here.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3n1b2/4R3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1BK1 w - - 1 10; Commentary: The most popular move.Black's idea is to play Re8 next move and try to go with the knight on f5.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3n1b2/8/3P4/8/PPP1RPPP/RNBQ1BK1 b - - 2 10; Commentary: The credit for this paradoxical maneouvre goes toMVL (see above). At first point it looks completely ridiculous. But what isthe point behind it? White anticipates that most action will happen on thee-file in the future. This move retains the possibility of playing Ra1-Re1 inthe very far future, after developing his queenside completely. Also, in thecase of Re8 White has Bf4 without worrying about d4 pawn. In the 8th game ofthe 2013 Chennai match Carlsen played 10 Re1.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p1n1b2/8/3P4/8/PPP1RPPP/RNBQ1BK1 w - - 0 11; Commentary: The best reaction to Re2,in my opinion. Threatening Ba6 forces the rook to move again, since Whitedoesn't want to exchange light squared bishops immediately.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/p1pp1ppp/1p1n1b2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QRBK1 b - - 3 12; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Excellent move. Because of the moveb6 White can afford to play this developing move without worrying about d4.That is some very deep 21st century opening subtlety.
FEN: r5k1/pbppbppp/1p1n4/8/3P1B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4BK1 w - - 0 16; Commentary: And for the third time in the match we have aqueenless endgame practically directly out of opening. White has a slightadvantage because his pieces are slightly better coordinated and he has morespace. However, Black doesn't have any weaknesses.

The situation is similar a in the first game, where Carlsen's knightis slightly superior to it's bishop's counterpart, but things should peter toa draw quickly.

FEN: 8/4R3/2N2k2/5P1K/1p5p/1P5r/8/8 b - - 2 70; Commentary: The first critical moment where Carlsen misses the win. The winningidea consists of defending the b pawn with the knight from a secure positionwhile controlling the h pawn.

However the move in the game lets White witha better position as well. I think it is better for Black to avoid the Nxe4altogether in this situation

Kg2 is a blunder, because it blocksthe rook's path to h file, This move was the result of the wrong notation ofthe moves. Let me explian.

FEN: 2k5/1p2R3/p1p5/P1Pb4/4r1P1/4B1K1/8/8 w - - 1 52; Commentary: The first game in which Karjakin managed to rise his head and obtain seriouschances. Again my match forecast ( I must be really boring by now) turns outto be correct. Carlsen after missing serious chances in games three in fourtries to "win by force" and almost ends up being punished for it.

FEN: 1r2rbk1/2p3p1/p1bn1p2/4p3/2p5/P1P3NP/1P3PPN/2BRR1K1 w - - 0 25; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Once again we have a "queenless middlegame". Black'schances are undoubtly better, his pieces are nice, he has a pair of strongbishops, and b2 is weak. The plan for Black is to play on both wings, and usepressure on queenside with push of the pawns in the centre and on the kingside.

FEN: 8/5b2/1b4k1/p3B1p1/2p2pP1/P1P5/1P2K3/3N4 w - - 0 46; Commentary: This was condemned by almosteveryone. Magnus overlooked the possibility of the fortress, as he admittedthat he simply thought he has to breakthrough somehow. He will manage to gethis king on b3, but his bishops are unable to deal with the barricades on thekingside by themselves.

FEN: r2q1rk1/1bp1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Here we go. In analysis to gamefour i mentioned that this move is possible. In my database this was firstplayed in the game Quesada P. - Nielsen P.H., Capablanca Memorial Elite 2007.It is indicative because Nielsen is Carlsen's second.
FEN: r2q1rk1/1bp1bppp/p7/1p1nN3/3n4/1B1P3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 12; Commentary: This move is also very well known in this position

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4; Commentary: In my database there are 14 games where Magnus hashad this position on the board. Last time he play the Slav was 4 years ago atthe Tata Steel Chess tournament 2012.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: This is the move he hasencountered most often. 9 times in 14 games

FEN: rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: I think this is a somewhat rare move. With this move Black instantlytransposes in a position similar to Queen's gambit declined lines, where Whitehas played e3. I am not entirely certain, but I think that current state oftheory says that e3 variation of the queen's gambit is pretty harmless forBlack.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p1pn2/8/2BP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Black's plan is to playc5-b5-Bb7 in the next couple of moves. I think that there is no way for Whiteto stop this and that Black will have no trouble equalizing.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1pp5/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] I think that this position isnot dangerous for Black and that he has equalized.

FEN: r2qk2r/1b2bppp/p1n1p3/1p6/4N3/4P3/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The opening has finished.Black has equalized without problems. He has an advantage in development, alittle more space and no weaknesses.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1p6/1n2N3/BP2PB2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this is a bad move.It is brave to criticize the World Champion, but this is uncharacteristic forhim. Instead of trying to utilize his slightly better position, he goes for aposition with opposite coloured bishops where he will be a pawn down.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/1b2bppp/p3pN2/1p6/1n6/BP2PB2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 17; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Entering the tactical complications favourable for White
FEN: 5rk1/5ppp/B3pb2/8/1p6/1P2P3/P4PPP/3R2K1 w - - 0 23; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Entering the oppositecoloured bishop position with one pawn less. However, since black's b pawn iscontrollin White's two queenside pawns, White is unable to create a passedpawn.
FEN: 5rk1/5ppp/B3pb2/8/1p6/1P2P3/P4PPP/2R3K1 b - - 1 23; Commentary: There is nothing to comment on from here. The draw was soonagreed.
FEN: 3r2k1/5p1p/4pbp1/8/1p6/1P1BP3/P1R2PPP/6K1 w - - 4 26; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Black only has to avoidplaying Bc3 which would allow a4 in reply. While the pressure on a pawn exists,there is nothing to worry about.
FEN: 2r5/4kp2/4pb1p/6p1/1pB1KPP1/1P2P3/P1R4P/8 w - - 2 34; Commentary: From my point of view, this was the most dull game so far. After onceagain displaying great preparation, which hasn't been considered his forte,Carlsen avoided the most fighting continuations (which is considered his forte)and satisifed himself with a draw.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: After two e4 games, where he gained little against Berlin, and someadvantage with the Giuoco Piano, Carlsen returns to d4.

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Magnus is avoiding c3, and preparing to develop his bishop to b2.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Both sides have free development and don't confront each other for the moment.So, this is another typical Magnus opening. The goal is not so much to setBlack immediatey problems, but rather to simply get a game.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/2pp4/3P4/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 8; Commentary: The playershave been following the game Nakamura - Gelfand, London Classic 2013 so far.Gelfand chose to develop his knight first.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/8/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 8; Commentary: But this is somewhatunconventional and apparently a novelty, at least according to my database.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2bp4/8/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 9; Commentary: This suprised me a bit. A second move bythe bishop. I am not certain why Karjakin avoided bxc5, maybe to avoid playingwith the hanging pawns.
FEN: rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p2pn2/2bp4/8/1P1BPN2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Both sides have completedtheir development.

FEN: 2rr2k1/1b2qppp/1p2p1n1/p1b5/2NN2n1/PP2P3/1B3PPP/2RRQBK1 w - - 10 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Suddenly Black's piecesare getting really close to White's king

FEN: 2rr2k1/4qppp/1p2p1n1/pNbb4/P1N3n1/1P2P3/1B3PPP/2RRQBK1 w - - 1 21; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Black won the b4square at least
FEN: 2rr2k1/4qppp/1p2p1n1/pNbb4/P1NB2n1/1P2P3/5PPP/2RRQBK1 b - - 2 21; Commentary: The tension in the centre is growing, and Karjakin decides to release it.
FEN: 2rr2k1/4qppp/1p2p1n1/pN6/P1RR2n1/1P2P3/5PPP/4QBK1 b - - 0 23; Commentary: Idon't really understand this move. Carlsen is trying to keep the positionalive, but by creating imbalances in his position he doesn't achieve much, butmerely gives Black some targets.
FEN: 3r2k1/4qppp/1p2p1n1/pN6/P1PR2n1/4P3/5PPP/4QBK1 b - - 0 24; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Naturally. Carlsen wasn't going to take with the rook. However,this is objectively dubious, since White's pawns are quite weak now.
FEN: 1r4k1/4qpp1/1p2pn1p/pN2n3/P1PR4/4P1P1/3Q1PBP/6K1 w - - 0 28; Commentary: Making space for the king.

FEN: 1r4k1/N2n1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/P1PR1P2/q3P1P1/3Q2BP/6K1 w - - 3 30; Commentary: This is a great move, and was allowed by White's 28thmove.
FEN: 5rk1/3n1pp1/1pN1pn1p/p7/P1PR1P2/q3P1PP/3Q2B1/6K1 b - - 0 31; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Getting some "luft", and threatening Rxd7.
FEN: 5rk1/5pp1/1pN1pn1p/p1n5/P1PR1P2/q3P1PP/3Q2B1/6K1 w - - 1 32; Commentary: Now the a4 is a "gooner".White has to demonstrate that he has sufficient play for it. Another importantpoint is that both players had around 6 minutes on the clock at this point.
FEN: 3R1r2/5pk1/1pN1pnpp/p7/n1PQ1P2/q3P1PP/6BK/8 w - - 2 35; Commentary: Calmlywalking into a pin, correctly judging that White can't take advantage of that

FEN: 3N4/5pk1/1p1Qpnpp/p1n5/5P2/3qP1PP/6BK/8 w - - 2 38; Commentary: While I was watching this life, I immediately remembered the game sixof the last Carlsen - Anand match, where Magnus blundered heavily and got awaywith it. I couldn't believe that the history is repeating itself again.

FEN: 6k1/8/1p2pQpp/2n5/p3PP2/3q2PP/6BK/8 b - - 0 41; Commentary: This interference move wasprobably missed by Karjakin earlier in his calculations. Now g6 falls
FEN: 5qk1/8/1pQ1p2p/2n5/p3PP2/6PP/6BK/8 b - - 4 44; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A risky andunnecessary decision. Magnus, after weathering the storm, continues to playfor the win. With such a strong passed pawn for Black, and potentially a goodknight, it was rather unneccessary.
FEN: 3q2k1/8/1pQ1p2p/2n5/p3PP2/6PP/6BK/8 w - - 5 45; Commentary: Karjakin plays almost flawlesslyfrom this point on. Eyeing the e7 is good decision
FEN: 3q4/6k1/1pQ1P2p/2n5/4P3/p5PP/6BK/8 w - - 1 47; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Another good decision, removing the king from the potential Qa8 check.

FEN: 8/6k1/4Q2p/2q1n3/4P3/p5PP/6BK/8 b - - 6 51; Commentary: [pgndiagram]Played after the 5 minutes thought.Carslen either missed or understimated Black's response.
FEN: 8/6k1/4Q3/2q1n2p/4P3/p5PP/6BK/8 w - - 0 52; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Played alsorather quickly (after some 5 minutes). To my mind this is an amazing move.Black simply mates White out of nowhere. With such a weakened king. Kudos toKarjakin for finding this. This is the only way to finish the game immediately
FEN: 8/6k1/4Q3/2q1n2p/4P2P/6P1/p5BK/8 w - - 0 53; Commentary: Here Carlsen resigned, afterconvincing himself that his position is hopeless.

FEN: r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A new variation. Instead of offering Marshall asin games 2 and 4, Magnus goes for the Neo - Arkhangelsk variation. I thinkthat in modern times the move 6...Bc5 is played exclusively instead of the old6... Bb7. It is curious to see what Garry Kasparov wrote about this in his"Revolution in the 70s": "Apparently, Malanyuk was the first to conclude thatBlack should not hurry with 6... Bb7, and he began emplyoing the improvedvariation with 6.. Bc5" I am not versed enough into all the nuances tounderstand why this is so to be honest.

FEN: 1r1q1rk1/2p2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/3PP3/5P2/1PB2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The point of the variation. Black gives his bishoppair and a pawn. As a compensation he shatters White's kingside structure. Tobe honest, I am surprised that Magnus didn't go for Sicilian, or maybe evenFrench defence, in order to generate more imbalances. Because I think here itis hard to play for win with Black. But then again, maybe it wasn't neccessaryto go all in with the Black pieces yet.

FEN: 1r3rk1/5ppp/1b1p1q2/2p1P2n/3P4/4BP2/1PB2P1P/R2Q1R1K b - - 0 19; Commentary: The best indication that both players were still in theirpreparation are the times: 1:39:40 for Karjakin, 1:39:40 Carlsen (they startwith 1:40:00)

FEN: 1r3rk1/5ppp/1b1q4/7n/3P4/1B2BP2/5P1P/R2Q1R1K w - - 0 23; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Magnus still had 1:40:00 left on his clock. Onceagain he has reached probably equal position, but too be honest Black doesn'thave many chances to create some problems as well.

FEN: 6k1/8/4qbp1/1Q5p/5B2/5P1P/5PK1/8 w - - 15 75; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And finally a draw wasagreed. A fascinating clash where Karjakin played almost like a machine. Butto be honest, Carlsen's opening choice didn't leave him with manyopportunities to go wrong. At least that's my humble 2175 impression
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: Of course,there is no reason for Karjakin to deviate from the Berlin

FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppppbpp1/2n2n1p/1B2p3/4P2B/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 8; Commentary: It isinteresting to note that the bishop retreat was Magnus' choice when he facedthis position with Black in Shirov - Carlsen, Biel 2011. Also, here is hiscomment: " Once the white bishop is on h4, this loss of tempo is considered tobe justified"

FEN: 8/kp2r2r/2p1p1p1/PPNpPn1p/7P/3R1PPK/8/1R6 b - - 0 57; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Compared to the position onthe 55th move, White's rooks are on d3 and b1 instead of d2 and b3.

FEN: 8/1pk5/4r3/P2R3p/7P/6P1/6K1/8 b - - 1 71; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Karjakin could have resigned here. The White rook finds itself onan ideal square, defending a5 and attacking h5
FEN: 7r/kp6/5K2/P2R3p/7P/6P1/8/8 b - - 9 75; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Next is Kg7 and White will win. A game ofenormous significance, both for this match and for the chess history.Exploiting the drawing chance on move 20 would put Carlsen in a desperatesituation, where he would have only two more games to save his title. However,"fortune" follows the brave, and Magnus probably deserved to have at leastequal score at this point of the match. It will be interesting to follow thetwo remaining games, since Magnus will probably get huge psychological boostbecause of this result.

FEN: r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p1npbn2/1p2p3/4P3/PBNP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A nice idea. Black offers a bishopexchange which would ruin his pawn structure. But because of his mobility inthe centre and control of d5, he judges that it is not disadvantageous for him
FEN: r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p1npbn2/1p1Np3/4P3/PB1P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10; Commentary: A typical idea. Whiterefuses to go along with Black's plans, but jumps on the d5 square while it isavailable
FEN: r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p2pbn2/1p1Np3/3nP3/PB1P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 11; Commentary: Carlsen played this instantly. This move forced the exchange on d4, leavingBlack with a mobile pawn chain on the queenside. The player who played thisrelieveing move most often was Peter Svidler. There are 3 games from 2013 yearin my database where Svidler plays Black in this position.

FEN: r2q1rk1/2p3pp/p2ppb2/1p6/3pP3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is time to pause and evaluate the result of the opening. Blackhas a doubled pawn on the d-file, but it is hard for White to attack it or toplay against it. Furthermore, after the potential d5 in the future it is easyto get rid of that "weakness" On the other hand, White has a kingside pawnmajority. So he will play on that wing.
FEN: r2q1rk1/2p3pp/p2ppb2/1p6/3pPP2/P2P4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: Making a useful move whilekeeping his queen on the starting square for the moment and retaining theoption of the quick g4 push
FEN: r2q1rk1/6pp/p2ppb2/1pp5/3pPP2/P2P4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Apparently a novelty of thegame. Black creates a "triangle" in the centre, and has ideas about pushingfurther in the future.

However, Black has more space on the kingside,and in the games with lower time control parrying attacks is considerablyharder then in normal over the board play.

Such a pawn breakthroughis surely unpleasant to face when already low on time. Black simply gives up apawn for a complete Black square domination. Objectively position is stillequal, but now White has to find some precise move in order not to lose, whileBlack is hardly risking anything.

Objectively, there were other defensive movesavailable, but this sacrifice sets White concrete problems that such a strongplayer like Geller is unable to solve.

This idea is common - the assumptionis that the bishop on d2 doesn't stand ideally, so Black's spent tempo isjustified, as White will also have to spend a move in redeploying the bishop

One can hardly call this move a sacrifice, as White obtainsadequate material (three pawns) for the piece." - Euwe    This move was ratedvery highly. I agree: one has to give credit to Euwe's courage! At thisturning point of the match he played like Alekhine - he boldly launched hisknight at the enemy fortifications, sharply disrupting the quiet course of thegame. And although objectively there was little risk of White losing, for thetime being there is also no 'decisive advantage'. Instead, a very complicatedand highly unclear position arises.

FEN: 4k1r1/1b1r4/1nppNp2/1p2PPp1/1P4P1/2N3KR/2P5/7R b - - 0 35; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The knockout blow.With this clearance sacrifice, White opens the e4 square for his other knightand Black gets overwhelmed
FEN: 4k1r1/1b1r4/1np1Np2/1p2pPp1/1P2N1P1/6KR/2P5/7R b - - 1 36; Commentary: f6 and c5 are too weak, h-file is owned byWhite, the game is over
FEN: R1bk1r2/7R/2p2p2/1pNnpPp1/1P4P1/6K1/2P5/8 b - - 7 42; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Playing important games with great powerand energy was always Lasker's forte and he always managed to score a win whenhe needed one the most
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This wasPillsbury's favourite move against the Semi-Tarrasch defence, which issomewhat risky from the modern viewpoint.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/2PQ4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 7; Commentary: This looksnatural, but it might not be the best, as it allows the ruination of theBlack's kingside structure
FEN: r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/2P4Q/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 4 8; Commentary: And this is extremelyrisky. Half a century later, Keres suffered a hard defeat in a similar mannerfrom the hands of the Botvinnik
FEN: r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/q2p2B1/2P4Q/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 5 9; Commentary: [pgndiagram] White is in danger and has to play precisely

FEN: r3k2r/pp1bbppp/2n1pn2/q2p2B1/2P4Q/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/1K1R1B1R b kq - 2 10; Commentary: Allowing h6, after which White doesn't haveenough time for Bb5 ideas
FEN: r3k2r/pp1bbpp1/2n2n1p/q2p2B1/3N3Q/2N1P3/PP3PPP/1K1R1B1R b kq - 1 12; Commentary: [pgndiagram] White is forced to cut his losses
FEN: r4rk1/pp1b1pp1/2n2b1p/q2p3Q/3N4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/1K1R1B1R b - - 1 14; Commentary: It isapparent that White's opening hasn't been successful. But the spectacular partof the game is yet to follow
FEN: r4rk1/pp3pp1/4bb1p/q2p3Q/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 1 16; Commentary: It would appear that Laskeralready knew how he would respond to the advance of the f-pawn
FEN: r4rk1/pp3pp1/4bb1p/q2p3Q/3P1P2/2N5/PP4PP/1K1R1B1R b - - 0 16; Commentary: Probably not justified
FEN: 5rk1/pp3pp1/4bb1p/q2p1P1Q/3P4/2r5/PP4PP/1K1R1B1R w - - 0 18; Commentary: [pgndiagram]A brilliant combination.
FEN: 5rk1/pp3pp1/4Pb1p/q2p3Q/3P4/r7/PP4PP/1K1R1B1R w - - 1 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The crux of the combination. Black sacrifices his rook ona3, forcing White to take the rook and shatter his kingside pawn structure
FEN: 5rk1/pp3Pp1/5b1p/q2p3Q/3P4/r7/PP4PP/1K1R1B1R b - - 0 19; Commentary: And this is the losing move
FEN: 6k1/pp3rp1/1q3b1p/1B1p3Q/3P4/P7/P5PP/1K1R3R b - - 2 21; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Similarly as in previous variations, all other moves lose morequickly
FEN: 6k1/ppr3p1/5b1p/1q1p3Q/3P4/P7/P5PP/K2R3R w - - 2 23; Commentary: This move almost throws the whole advantage forBlack
FEN: 6k1/pp4p1/5b1p/1q1p3Q/2rP4/P7/P2R2PP/K2R4 b - - 5 24; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is now Pillsbury's moment to go wrong
FEN: 6k1/pp4p1/5b1p/1q1p3Q/3P4/P1r5/P2R2PP/K2R4 w - - 6 25; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Another error,which even passes the advantage to white
FEN: 6k1/pp4p1/5b1p/3p1Q2/2qP4/P1r5/P2R2PP/K2R4 w - - 8 26; Commentary: Now suddenly White hasto make only one precise move and he can even start thinking about winning
FEN: 6k1/pp4p1/5b1p/3p1Q2/2qP4/P1r5/PK1R2PP/3R4 b - - 9 26; Commentary: A tragic move and one of the historic chess moves with graveconsequences for Pillsbury.
FEN: 6k1/pp4p1/5b1p/3p1Q2/2qP4/r7/PK1R2PP/3R4 w - - 0 27; Commentary: [pgndiagram] For thesecond time in the game, the rook is sacrificed on a3. One of those instanceswhich induced Lasker's contemporaries to accuse him that he hypnotized hisopponents
FEN: 8/pp4pk/4Qb1p/3p4/2qP4/r7/PK1R2PP/3R4 w - - 2 28; Commentary: Once again a mistake
FEN: 8/pp4pk/4Qb1p/3p4/2qP4/K7/P2R2PP/3R4 b - - 0 28; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A final mistake of the game.Pillsbury walks in the previously examined mating pattern
FEN: 8/pp4pk/4Qb1p/3p4/3P4/K1q5/P2R2PP/3R4 w - - 1 29; Commentary: Now the gameis over
FEN: 8/p5pk/4Qb1p/1K1p4/2qP4/8/P2R2PP/3R4 w - - 1 31; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A fantastic struggle, inwhich Lasker almost threw away the deserved victory. If Pillsbury won thisgame, he would have also won the whole tournament and probably been regardedas the undisputed number one in the world. Alas...
FEN: r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram]One of those rare instances of the Dragon variation of the Sicilian in the20th century
FEN: r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/3NP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: The plan of the extended fianchetto is definitely not themost challenging one, but it is also not without it's venom if not handledproperly
FEN: r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8; Commentary: Nothing wrong with this, because White hardly has anothersquare for this knight. The g5 push is not that significant
FEN: r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP1P1/2N1B2P/PPP2P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: Thetypical idea of the variation. White intends to continue with Bg2, 0-0, f4 andattack on the kingside.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6P1/3NP3/2N1B2P/PPP2P2/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this is premature inmy opinion. White is not sufficiently developed for such displays of aggression
FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2np2p1/6P1/3NPP1P/2N1B3/PPP5/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 11; Commentary: Typcial Lasker, but once again, White should complete his developmentinstead
FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppn2pbp/2np2p1/4p1P1/3NPP1P/2N1B3/PPP5/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 12; Commentary: A typical reaction. Black responds to a wingattack with the central blow
FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppn2pbp/2n3p1/3pp1P1/4PP1P/2N1B3/PPP1N3/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 13; Commentary: But this, surprisingly is notthe best move in the position, although it is typical and does look ratherattractive
FEN: r1bq1rk1/ppn2pbp/6p1/3Pp1P1/3n1P1P/2N1B3/PPP1N3/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram]And this is almost a decisive mistake. In such a sharp position, every wrongmove is very costly.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/3npNP1/5P1P/2N1B3/PPP5/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 15; Commentary: Lasker was very strong in these positions
FEN: r1br3k/pp2Npbp/6p1/4p1PP/5P2/2n1B3/PPP5/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 18; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Afantastic conception. White ignores the piece, but simply continues to attack,even after the queen exchange
FEN: r1b1r2k/pp2Npbp/8/2B1p1Pp/5P2/2n5/PPP5/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 20; Commentary: And this is a serious mistake
FEN: r1b1r2k/pp2Npbp/8/2B1p1Pp/2B2P2/2n5/PPP5/R3K2R b KQ - 1 20; Commentary: The way chess was played in the early 20thcentury. Taking the piece was often rejected in favour of an attackingcontinuation
FEN: r1b1r2k/pp2Npbp/8/2B3Pp/2B2p2/2n5/PPP5/R3K2R w KQ - 0 21; Commentary: The position is obviously very complex. Black defends the knight in anindirect way, but this proves to be another tactical mistake
FEN: r1b1B2k/pp2N2p/8/2B3Pp/4np2/2b5/P1P5/1R3K1R b - - 3 24; Commentary: [pgndiagram]At the moment, White has aclear rook for two pawns, but Black can regain some of his material
FEN: r6k/pR2N2p/8/2B3Pn/5p2/2b5/P1P3K1/8 b - - 0 28; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is not hard to understand why Napierwent for this position. The material is equal, and White's position doesn'tlook that threatening. However, in reality, Black is completely tied up
FEN: r6k/4N2p/8/p1B3Pn/5p2/1Rb5/P1P3K1/8 b - - 1 29; Commentary: Changing the track and going for the h-pawn
FEN: r6k/4N1bp/8/p1B3P1/5p2/5KnR/P1P5/8 b - - 5 31; Commentary: [pgndiagram] All Black's pawns are weak and White's pieces are much more active
FEN: 7k/4N1bp/r7/p1B2KP1/n7/P6R/2P5/8 w - - 1 35; Commentary: A final blunder
FEN: 7k/4N1bp/r7/p4KP1/n7/P3B2R/2P5/8 b - - 2 35; Commentary: [pgndiagram]There is no way of preventing g6, with decisive threats.Black finally resigned. Another fantastic struggle with many mistakes, inwhich Lasker managed to outplay his opponent from an aggressive, but dubiousposition
FEN: r2qkb1r/pppbnppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This isSteinitz's classical defence. The knight is heading to g6, bolstering the e5square. On the other hand, Black loses some time. White should be better inthis variation, but Black is rather solid
FEN: r2qk2r/1ppbbppp/p2p2n1/8/3QP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Not allowingthe exchange of the bishops. White has more space, but in this Spanishstructure (e4 vs d6 pawn) Black has less space, but he doesn't have anyweaknesses (his pawn structure is compact).
FEN: r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1bp1bn1/3N4/4P1P1/4B3/PPPQBP1P/2KR3R b - - 0 14; Commentary: But this is premature agression. Pawns don't move backwards. Although thismove is played automaticaly by many lower rated players, pawn attacks shouldalways be prepared
FEN: r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/p2p1bn1/3Q2P1/4P3/4B3/PPP1BP1P/2KR3R b - - 0 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A second mistake, after which White is seriously worse
FEN: r2q2k1/1pp2ppp/p2p1bn1/4r1P1/4P3/4B3/PPPQBP1P/2KR3R b - - 2 17; Commentary: After this white loses two pawns withoutany compensation
FEN: r2q2k1/1pp2ppp/p2p2n1/6b1/4rP2/4B3/PPPQB2P/2KR3R w - - 0 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram]The tactical point. Black exploits the position of the White bishops and winshis piece back
FEN: r5k1/1pp1qppp/p2p2n1/6P1/4r3/4B3/PPPQB2P/2K2R1R b - - 2 20; Commentary: The final mistake
FEN: r5k1/1pp1qppp/p2p2n1/6P1/2B5/4r3/PPPQ3P/2K2R1R b - - 1 21; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Objectively, White should be lost. But Lasker's stubbornes is themain reason why this not so spectacular game has became famous. He digs in,creates his chances and continues playing like nothing has happened
FEN: r5kn/1pp1qppp/p2p4/6P1/2B5/4r3/PPPQ3P/2K2R1R w - - 2 22; Commentary: A typical Steinitz move, but slightly artificial
FEN: r5kn/1p2qppp/p1pp2P1/8/2B4P/4r3/PPPQ4/2K2R1R b - - 0 23; Commentary: Very creative. Throwing in another pawn justto open the kingside completely
FEN: r5kn/1p2qppp/p1p3P1/3p4/2B4P/4r3/PPPQ4/2K2R1R w - - 0 24; Commentary: [pgndiagram] And immediately Steinitzmakes a mistake that probably throws the win away already
FEN: r5kn/1p2qpp1/p1p5/3p3P/8/3Br3/PPPQ4/2K2R1R b - - 0 26; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Although Black is still material up, the situation has changed.White's pieces are perfectly placed, the knight is out of play, and files areopened. Still, two pawns mean Black is not worse, but he isn't clearly betteranymore as well
FEN: 4r2n/1p2qpkP/p1p3p1/3p4/8/3Br3/PPPQ4/1K3R1R b - - 2 29; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this move is really amazing; at the height of thebattle White makes a quiet move with his king and puts the ball into Black'scourt. Although it is by no means the best move in this position, this putsSteinitz in a hard psychological position
FEN: 4r2n/1p3pkP/p1p3p1/3pq3/8/3Br3/PPPQ4/1K3R1R w - - 3 30; Commentary: This is better place for the queenthan g5
FEN: 4r2n/1p3pkP/p5p1/3pq3/2p4Q/P2Br3/1PP5/1K3R1R b - - 1 32; Commentary: [pgndiagram] "In this game there is a certain Tal effect.White's attack is rather abstract, but it will not come to an end."
FEN: 4r2n/1p4kP/p4pp1/3pqB2/2p4Q/P3r3/1PP5/1K3R1R b - - 1 33; Commentary: Kasparov refuses to give an exclamation mark to this move, but to my mindit is amazing. White simply gives up a piece
FEN: 4r2n/1p3k1P/p4pp1/3pqB2/2p4Q/P3r3/1PP5/1K3R1R w - - 2 34; Commentary: Not yet fatal, but therewere better alternatives
FEN: 4r1Rn/1p2k2P/p4p2/3pqp1Q/2p5/P3r3/1PP5/1K3R2 b - - 3 36; Commentary: [pgndiagram]
FEN: 4r1Rn/1p5P/p2k1p2/3pqp1Q/2p5/P3r3/1PP5/1K3R2 w - - 4 37; Commentary: With mating ideas connected with c3 unavailable, It was betterto keep the king in touch with the rook on e8
FEN: 4r1Rn/1p5P/p2kqp2/3p1R1Q/2p5/P3r3/1PP5/1K6 w - - 1 38; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A final mistake
FEN: 4q2n/1p5P/p4R1Q/2kp4/2p5/P3r3/1PP5/1K6 b - - 2 40; Commentary: The f-pawn was more important than the d and c pawns
FEN: 4q2n/1p2r2P/p4R2/2kp4/2p5/P7/1PP4Q/1K6 b - - 4 41; Commentary: [pgndiagram] In practical game it would be extremely hard to playBlack here, even if he wasn't completely lost
FEN: 7n/1p2r2P/p2k1Q2/8/2pp4/P7/1PP5/1K6 b - - 2 46; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A fascinating game, very hard to judge from themodern viewpoint since it contains many mistakes detected instantly by theengines. But you can try to imagine how incomprehensive it was for thecontemporaries; I really doubt highly anyone understood what a fierce battlebetween two chess gladiators this encounter really was.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: This is the first timethat Lasker avoided 1 e4 in the match
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Atthose time 4..g6 contradicted everything taught about chess. "I did not wantto play for a draw in the last game and I chose a little-known continuation,leading to interesting complications." - Schlechter
FEN: rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 5 7; Commentary: AvoidingBg4 at all costs, but this costs him a tempo
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/n1p2np1/1p6/2BP4/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this is too extravagant.Black is weakening his queenside without any good reason
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/n1p2np1/1p6/3P4/P1NBPN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10; Commentary: Now Black's queenside construction is silly
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/n1p2np1/8/1p1P4/P1NBPN2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11; Commentary: This is also probablynot necessary. You can feel that equal play didn't interest Schlechter
FEN: r2q1rk1/pb2ppbp/n1p2np1/8/N2P4/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 13; Commentary: Butafter this Black is indeed almost lost
FEN: r2q1rk1/pb2ppbp/n1p2np1/8/N2P4/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/1RB1K2R b K - 2 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now White hascomplete control of the board and c5 is never in question
FEN: r4rk1/pbq1ppbp/n1p2np1/4N3/N2P4/P2BP3/2Q2PPP/1RB1K2R b K - 4 14; Commentary: However, at this moment Lasker starts playing nervously
FEN: r4rk1/pbq1ppbp/n1p3p1/4N2n/N2P2P1/P2BP3/2Q2P1P/1RB1K2R b K - 0 15; Commentary: Lasker explained this move with the fllowing words: "When so much depends onone game, the players become very excited and their imagination transformsinto recklessness"
FEN: r4rk1/pbq1pp1p/n1p3p1/4b2P/N2P4/P2BP3/2Q2P1P/1RB1K2R b K - 0 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Also a mistake, Black's bishop was more important

FEN: 5r1k/p1n1prb1/2R5/7q/N2P1P2/P2Q1R2/3BK3/8 b - - 0 34; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This pawn grabbing when under fire is usually not to berecommended

FEN: 8/Q3pkq1/3n4/3R4/K7/P7/8/8 b - - 0 55; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Whitecaptures the a-pawn and now the rest is indeed a matter of the technique andprecision
FEN: 8/nk2p3/8/2K5/8/P7/2R5/8 b - - 10 71; Commentary: [pgndiagram] An endof a titanic struggle and the most difficult match for Lasker. One of the mostbeautiful games in the history, unique because of the fact that both sidesplayer for the win with extremely high stakes. Naturally, the fight containedmany mistakes, but the complications and the irrationality of the positioneasily excuse these mistakes
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: A rare move, but a playable one nevertheless
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2B3p1/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: As already mentioned, Lasker enjoyed exchanging his bishop for theknight on c6. With this move White transposes to some sort of anti-Berlin lines
FEN: r2qk1nr/ppp2pbp/2p1b1p1/4p3/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 7; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The position is somewhat resemblinga Rossolimo line of the Sicilian. White's plan might include the advance inthe centre (d4) or play on the kingside. Black's plan will depend on the placeof the White king
FEN: r3k1nr/ppp1qpbp/2p1b1p1/4p3/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 8; Commentary: I don't like this move, it was more flexible todevelop a knight on this square
FEN: r3k1nr/ppp1qpbp/4b1p1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 9; Commentary: Black also weakens his queenside and indeed transposes to the unfavorableSicilian structure. The subsequent games in the 20th century would show thatthese positions are quite dangerous for Black.   Another drawback of this moveis that due to the queen on e7, Black's knight is far away from the d4 square

FEN: 8/nk2p3/8/2K5/8/P7/2R5/8 b - - 10 71; Commentary: [pgndiagram] An endof a titanic struggle and the most difficult match for Lasker. One of the mostbeautiful games in the history, unique because of the fact that both sidesplayer for the win with extremely high stakes. Naturally, the fight containedmany mistakes, but the complications and the irrationality of the positioneasily excuse these mistakes

Black tries to solvehis problems immediately by creating a tension in the centre. At the highestlevel this is practically a novelty. I have only one game where this move wasplayed by 2700+ grandmaster. And moreover, it was a blitz game by Ian Nepomnia...Nepo..

FEN: r3kb1r/pp1bnppp/1q2p3/3pP3/1n1P3P/N4N2/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This is one of those complicatedsubtle grandmaster moves that confuses me. Black's idea is to prevent the Nc2move by White.   However I am not certain whether such subtle measures areneccessary, since it removes the tension from the d4 pawn.

FEN: r1bqk2r/pppn1pp1/5n1p/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: Black's plan ofteninvolves weakening of the pawn structure on the kingside in order to get ridof the bishop.   I have analyzed some variations of the Ragozin and often seenthis idea. However, for some reason, Black players have more often avoided h6in favour of the immediate advance of the c5.

Altogether he has less than 20 games in my database on the Blackside of the Caro Kann, and that includes blitz and rapid games as well

He could have resigned here without any hesitation. The conversionperiod probably lasted longer than neccessary, but the result was never indoubt.

FEN: r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4; Commentary: This is a sign of times however. The factthat such a dynamic player as Topalov has taken the Berlin indicates how riskyit is nowadays to play for the win as Black.   Topalov probably wanted to takea respite and make an easy draw. Considering his tournament situation it madesome sense, but this game proves that even with Berlin it is hard to make adraw when you are totally out of form.

FEN: r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This delayedexchange has also become popular in recent times, together with 5 c3. The ideaof shattering Black's queenside structure is ancient in the Ruy Lopez.
FEN: r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] White knight usually ends up on c4, and from there he heads fore3, or even a5 in some variations. White thinks that static pawn structurewon't allow opening the position for the Black bishops.

FEN: r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/4b3/4PP2/8/PPPN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This looks very loose, but itis the only consistent continuation. White gains some space on the kingside,and the character of the play is somewhat different.
FEN: r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2p1bp2/8/3bPP2/8/PPPN2PP/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 0 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This move is neccessary, Black shouldcreate a spot for his bishop on f7 to keep his pieces more coordinated

FEN: r2qk2r/ppp2bpp/1bp5/4pP2/6Q1/2P5/PP1N2PP/R1B2R1K b kq - 1 16; Commentary: Adams' excellent preparation has yielded him a very promising position. It ishard for Black to navigate the position and find the best move

FEN: r5r1/pppk1b1p/1bp5/4QP2/8/2Pq4/PP1N2PP/R1B2R1K w - - 1 19; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now it seems that Black ahs good compensation,since White can't move his knight. But Adams has calculated precisely andcorrectly judged that he will manage to extricate himself from this position

FEN: 4r1r1/pppk1b1p/qbp2P2/8/4Q3/2P5/PP1N2PP/R1B2R1K w - - 1 21; Commentary: After this Black is just lost, because tactics won't allowhim to intercept the queen f5 check.   But finding the best practical try wasnot at all an easy task.

After the game he claimed that 21 Nf5was found by his second Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and that the resulting positionsare extremely favourable for White, but I am not so sure..

FEN: 1r5k/5r2/p6R/1q2pB1P/4P3/4B3/1PP5/2KR4 b - - 1 32; Commentary: Here Topalovresigned. But this final position is similar to the one examined below, withthe queen on b4 instead of b5
FEN: 1r6/6R1/p2kB2R/1q2p2P/4P3/4B3/1PP5/2K5 b - - 2 37; Commentary: The big difference is in this move. With the queen on b4there would be mate on e1, whereas now Black can simply resign.

FEN: 2r1k2r/1bqnbpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/3NPPP1/P1N2Q2/1PP2BBP/1K1R3R b k - 4 15; Commentary: In thisparticular position it is more important to improve the position of the kingthan to "lash out" with some agresive moves.

FEN: 2r1k2r/1bqnbp2/p2ppn1p/1p4p1/3NPPP1/P1N4Q/1PP2BBP/1K1R3R b k - 1 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This queen move was suggested by the engine instead of h4 in theCaruana - Nakamura game. It is certainly very interesting, as White nowthreatens to take on g5
FEN: 2r1k2r/1bq1bp2/p2ppn1p/1pn3p1/3NPPP1/P1N4Q/1PP2BBP/1K1R3R w k - 2 17; Commentary: And MVL is immediately rattled and makes astep in the wrong direction. And a step in the wrong direction usually meansserious problems in the sharp Sicilian // I have to correct myself here.Initially I thought that this move is bad, but after analyzing thealternatives, it would appear that after 16 Qh3! Black's position is bad allthe same. It seems like improvement has to be found somewhere earlier. Atleast Nakamura's preparation has cast serious doubt on the entire line.
FEN: 2r1k2r/1bq1bp2/p2ppn2/1pn3pp/3NPPP1/P1N4Q/1PP2BBP/1K1RR3 w k - 0 18; Commentary: MVL plays very dynamically andcreates as much confusion on the board as possible. But unfortunately for him,his position is very bad and White is spoilt for choice here.

FEN: rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] I have to correect my analysis from the other games.In this 5... 0-0 move order, White has to allow the early c5 possibility byBlack.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7; Commentary: The immediate try to free the Black's position

FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2bp4/2P2B2/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This position is familiar to Anand, since he played the Whiteside of this position in the 2014 World Championship match. It is interestingthat here he choses the move originally prepared by the ... Magnus himself.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2bp4/2P2B2/P1N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 4 10; Commentary: Here White had tons of possibilities. I highlyrecommend you to check the Anand - Carlsen, World Championship Sochi 2014 gamethat was annotated by GM Evgeny Postny for the chessbase.

FEN: r1bqr1k1/p4p1p/5p2/nPbNp3/3p4/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 1 15; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The thing I like about Anand is that he is full of these"once in a while" possibilities, and always seems to find some moves that setopponents some opening problems.  Unless that opponent's name is MagnusCarlsen, though
FEN: r1bqr1k1/p4p1p/5p2/nPb5/1N1p4/P4N2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 16; Commentary: White's position is not lost yet, but he is definitelyworse. And it is rather hard to play his position. Especially against a wellprepared opponent.

Unfortunately for Topalov, when you are out of form, you losepositions that you would normaly hold even in a blitz.  Although to be honest,with such a king it is always uncomfortable to be constantly aware of theBlack's many threats

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: Throughout this career,Tal was playing all four main moves by White, although he was mainly 1.e4player - especially in his youth. Still, I guess he had his reasons for theopening choice in this game - although it is not unfair to say that back in1957, the significance of the opening stage at the top level was much lesssignificant compared to today.
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: The King'sIndian was brought to the forefront at the end of 1940s and beginning of 1950s(particularly through the effors of Boleslavsky and Bronstein, among others)so it is not a surprising opening choice for Tolush - especially when weconsider the traits of his style!
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: The Saemisch variations is one ofthe sharpest and arguably most critical ways of meeting the King's Indiandefence. The idea is to keep the center fluid, castle queenside and go for thesharp g4-h4 attack. It has remained quite popular to this day. and was testedextensively in one of the Karpov-Kasparov matches, although nowadays theneural networks are suggesting some other ways as more critical.
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: Thistypical central counterstrike, characteristic of the King's Indian defence, isnot the most popular move by today's standards as it reveals Black'sintentions prematurely, but we shouldn't judge the state of the opening theoryfrom 1957 too harshly. It has to be said that this move was played by somestrong players like Ivanchuk and Sindarov, so it has every right to exist.
FEN: rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6; Commentary: A standard move in the Saemisch, defending the d4 point and intendingthe Be3/Bg5-Qd2-O-O-O developing scheme. Once again - other moves are possible,but I wouldn't want to delve too deeply in the opening stage of this game.
FEN: r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7; Commentary: Also a bit strange as the knight is passive here and it blocks thelight-squared bishop, although some strong players have played this even in2020s.
FEN: r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p1B1/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7; Commentary: [%cal Gh7h6,Gd1d2] Developing the bishop on a more activesquare than e3 as the d4 pawn is not under the attack here. White is trying toprovoke h6.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 9; Commentary: [%csl Gc4,Gd5,Ge4] A very typical idea, closing thecenter before starting the kingside attack. White is not yet hurrying withcastling and intends to keep the king in the center for a bit, as it turns outit is more difficult for Black to create counterplay with the king in thecenter compared to the king on the queenside.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pPp1B1/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10; Commentary: [%csl Gc4,Rc5,Gd5,Rd6,Ge4,Re5] This closing of the center was relatively a standard proceudre in thepast, but it is just bad for Black as now White has a free hand on thekingside.

Although this is purely from the engineperspective - it doesn't yet relinquish White's advantage - it just reduces itsomewhat.

FEN: 1n4k1/4q1r1/4R2Q/2pP2p1/2p5/8/PP6/2K2R2 b - - 0 42; Commentary: And here Tolush finally decided to throwin the towel. Perhaps not the most beautiful game by Mikhail Tal, but the oneI felt is a good introduction to his style and to some of the laterbrilliancies we will see in this article. --- Furthermore, I find these oldergames very instructive mainly because quite often, one side (in this caseTolush) completely misplays the opening and gets in a lost position early on -which is something that happens very often at the club level. Seeing a playerof Tal caliber handling such a position - and also misplaying it at certainmoments - can be regarded as more instructive and relatable than, say, recentencounters at the very top level.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: In this game,Tal opened with his favourite move.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: The Sicilian, leading to a sharpbattle, was always a risky opening choice against a player as tacticallygifted as Tal, but I guess Koblents had his reasons for choosing it.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6; Commentary: The Classical Sicilian has beenovershadowed by Najdorf, Sveshnikov and some other Sicilians in the recentyears, but it remains a very respectable opening to this day. Back in the dayit was very popular - among other players, Mikhail Botvinnik used to play iton a regular basis at some point in his career.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 5 9; Commentary: This move avoids the typicalexchange of the knights on d4. It is a very respectable and viable option,although less popular and arguably critical than the immedaite advance of thepawns on the kingside.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/1qnppn2/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 6 10; Commentary: This is the most popular move inthe position. The idea is to indirectly defend the d6 pawn and vacate the d8square for the rook while avoiding any Nb5 ideas. Still, it is probably not togood, objectively speaking as the queen is put in front of the queenside pawns- and Black will very much want to attack on that side of the board.

A fascinating, mind-boggling and typicalTal encounter, where he very successfully took his opponent into the "deepdark forest" and outwitted him in a sharp tactical melee. Games like theseprobably contributed to Botvinnik calling Tal's style "gambling", but evenwith the modern engines it is necessary to dive really deep to understand allthe intricacies and nuances of different tactical lines. --- I can onlyimagine how difficult it was to face this style over the board - especially inthe Botvinnik-Smyslov time where logic, harmony and positional player trumpedthis sacrificial, combinational style.

Talsacrifices the queen, but in return he will get two pieces and eliminate theopponent's dark-squared bishop. Even the materialistic engine approves of thisdecision.

But objectively,Black should have more than sufficient compensation for the queen due to theharmonious pawn structure and powerful dark-squared bishop.

Black not only has compensation for the missing material - atthis point Black is completely winning due to the quality of his pieces andthe harmony of his position.

A tremendous game by Tal, featuring a fully correct queen sacrifice,that I imagine was very revolutionary, novel for the time.

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: Smyslov is known for his contributions to the Ruy Lopez - an opening he usedto play a lot with both colours. However, 1...e5 was not his only replyagainst the king's pawn opening as throughout his career he also regularlyemployed both the Sicilian and Caro-Kann. He already played 1...c6 in theprevious round of the tournament against Fischer, so it surely didn't come asa major surprise to Tal.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: A peculiar opening choice. This line isrelatively innocuous, but Tal (and Koblents) probably had his (their)reasoning behind this choice.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pp3/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: A very principled replyagainst this King's Indian Attack setup by White (it is precisely this moveWhite tries to avoid by playing 3.Nf3 first).
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5; Commentary: But this is aserious inaccuraccy, that kinda demonstrates the level of opening play at thetime. Black allows White to open up the center under favourable circumstances.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p5/8/3QN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: It is true that White has losta tempo in moving the d-pawntwice in the opening and that now all the central pawns have been exchanged,but now White has a nice lead in development. Furthermore, since Black playedc6, the d6 square has been weakened and it is actually not super easy forBlack to deal with this.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/8/3QN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8; Commentary: A natural developing move can't be too bad.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2pN1n2/6B1/3Q4/5N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 6 10; Commentary: Now this knight jump doesn't come with thesame effect as Black is not forced to capture it.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/2pN1n2/q5B1/3Q4/5N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 7 11; Commentary: This is a bitoverzealous on Smyslov's part. However, this does change the character of playand invites tactical complications where the value of each move issignificantly increased.

FEN: r1b2rk1/p2nbppp/2pN1n2/qp6/2BQ4/5N2/PPPB1PPP/2KR3R b - - 1 12; Commentary: A very typical Tal move and a very surprisingcounter. The idea is to eventually reposition the bishop to c3 and aim at theblack king.

FEN: r1bb1rk1/p2n1ppp/q1p2n2/1p3N2/2B4Q/5N2/PPPB1PPP/2KR3R b - - 5 14; Commentary: Basically burning all the bridges and sacrificing thepiece in order to create some nasty kingside threats. It has to be said thatTal is objectively not risking that much at this particular point as his playis quite dangerous, but when you consider how good the position could havebeen after the earlier Nd6 knight jump, it does seem a bit unecessary. ---Then on the other hand, if Tal wasn't such a daredevil, we probably wouldn'tbe analyzing this (as well as many other) games of his.

Even though manypeople associate Smyslov with quiet, positional play, he was a brilliantcalculator/tactician in his own right, so it is natural that he was tempted toplay for more than a draw - especially if you take into the account that hehad beaten Tal in the first round of this tournament.

FEN: r1b5/p5pp/1bN1k3/8/2pBn3/4K3/1PP2PPP/R6R b - - 4 26; Commentary: And here Smyslov decided to throw in the towel. A marvellous,fascinating game that demonstrated that even the great players like Smyslov (albeit out of form) can succumb to Tal's psychological pressure and hurricanelike pressure over the board. ---After this game, the path of the twocompetitors diverged. Tal would go on to score a very convincing tournamentvictory and then beat the great Botvinnik in the 1960 World Championship match,while Smyslov would finish with a mediocre performance and slowly beovershadowed by the talented generation in the 1960s and would not seriouslyfight for the World title all the way until his resurgence in the 1980s (andhis final Candidates match against Garry Kasparov - in 1983!).
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: No hesitation. Very natural for Tal to go for his favourite move in themost important event of his career up to that point.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: The French wasalways one of Botvinnik's favourite openings throughout his career, althoughin this particular match, this was the only game where he dared venturing it,switching to Caro-Kann from the very next Black game. Apart from these twoopenings, he was also a Sicilian player, but it is quite natural that hismatch strategy didn't involve going for such a sharp opening against Tal.

FEN: rnb1k1r1/ppq1n2Q/4p3/3pPp2/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BK1BNR b q - 1 11; Commentary: A veryextravagant move, side-stepping the check on c3, but also the one on e5. Fromthe opening principle viewpoint, it looks as if this move is total nonsense,so let's try to explain it. Apart from the fact it parries the direct threats,the king is actually not at all so badly placed in the center due to the factthat Black's pawns are keeping all the lines closed and it is not clear howBlack will go about attacking it.

In these Winawer positions where Whitecaptures on g7 and h7, the passed h-pawn is a very big asset as very often itcreates havoc in the Black camp and gets pushed very far very early in thegame. Furthermore, this opens up the h3 square for the rook.

Due to thebishop on g5 they can't castle and it is hard to tell what else should be theplan. This move tries to exploit Black's lead in development at least,although White is not THAT far behind + Black's king is also quite weak.

One of the most one-sided opening games of the World Championship Matchand one of the worst defeats for not only Botvinnik, but any World Champion.This game is perhaps not the most typical Tal game, but it is one thatencapsulates very well his splendid feeling for such complicated, sharp andtactical positions - a true Model Game for all Winawer afficionados. It is notsurprising that Botvinnik decided to avoid the French for the rest of thematch.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: Throughout his life, Botvinnik had affinity forthe English Opening, although he was, naturally, a big master of 1.d4 as well.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 6; Commentary: Given Tal's style, The King'sIndian Defense was not a surprising choice.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 7; Commentary: I was under theimpression that developing schemes with the knight on d7 are nowadays rare andunexplored, but now I see that it is the most common move in the databaseagainst the Fianchetto setup by White, so what do I know. The idea is to placethe knight on a square where it supports e5 but where it isn't in the way ofthe d-pawn. Against the fianchetto setup, Black doesn't always go for thetypical kingside attack with f5-f4, so the knight arguably has moreflexibility on d7 than it would have, say, on c6 (or e7, following d5 by White).
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8; Commentary: Occupying the center is most ambitious, also not the onlyway of handling the position. It seems as if White is locking the bishop on g2,but the argument is that seizing the space advantage while trying to limitBlack's counterplay is very principled - especially since Black oftenexchanges on d4 on the next move.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9; Commentary: [%csl Gd5][%cal Gc6d5] This is also avery common line. Black opens the way for the queen and adds some more controlto the d5 square.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9; Commentary: [%csl Gg4][%cal Gh3g4,Rc8g4] Taking the g4 square under control isvery useful as it prevents the future Bg4, fighting for the d4 square.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10; Commentary: [%cal Rb6d4,Rb6b2] This queen move is also the most common move in thisposition, but it is questionable whether it is necessarily the best. Now thethreat is to capture on d4 and then on e4 and White needs to react, butBlack's queen can easily become exposed to some unexpected ideas on thissquare.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10; Commentary: [%csl Gd5] Botvinnik embarks on a typical King's Indian move,gaining some more space and locking the center. However, in this particularposition, it is probably more precise to either keep the tension, or go for asharp pawn sacrifice, which we will see in notes very shortly.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/1q1p1np1/2nPp3/4P3/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12; Commentary: Now we have reached a verytypical King's Indian position where White has more space, but where Black hassome pieces on the queenside and the c-file to work with.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/1q1p1np1/2nPp3/4P3/2N3PP/PP3PB1/R1BQNRK1 b - - 2 12; Commentary: The ideais to head to d3 and eliminate Black's active knight on c5.
FEN: r1r3k1/pp1b1pbp/1q1p1np1/3Pp3/4P3/2NQ2PP/PP3PB1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 15; Commentary: This move is a bit provocative and semi-waiting. Black gives upthe plan of pushing the f-pawn (for which the rook was ideal on f8) for nowand brings the heavy pieces to the open c-file.
FEN: r1r3k1/pp1b1pbp/1q1p1np1/3Pp3/4P3/2NQ2PP/PP3PB1/1RB2RK1 b - - 2 15; Commentary: [%cal Gb1b2] Defending b2 and preparingto develop the bishop.
FEN: r1r3k1/pp1b1pbp/1q1p2p1/3Pp2n/4P3/2NQ2PP/PP3PB1/1RB2RK1 w - - 3 16; Commentary: A bit inconsistent with the previous move of Rfc8,but as I mentioned, Tal was somewhat deliberately playing in a veryprovocative manner.
FEN: r5k1/pp1b1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/1qr1P3/2N1B1PP/PP2QPB1/1R3RK1 w - - 7 18; Commentary: Pushing the f-pawn is stillimpossible due to the potentially hanging knight on h5 so Tal brings the rookinto the action.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp1b1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/1qr1P3/2N1B1PP/PP2QPB1/1RR3K1 w - - 9 19; Commentary: Doubling on the c-file looks logical,but objectively, Black's pieces shouldn't be able to achieve all that much andshould be pushed back from the c-file in the near future.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp1b1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/1qr1P3/2N1B1PP/PP2QPBK/1RR5 b - - 10 19; Commentary: It issensible to move the king out of the harm's way. The engines suggest someweird looking, computer lines as better options, but I was unable to quiteunderstand them so I haven't bothered including them in the annotations, sincethe main highlight of the game is just in front of us anyway.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp1b2bp/3p2p1/3Ppp1n/1qr1P3/2N1B1PP/PP2QPBK/1RR5 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Now Blackfinally strikes with the f-pawn, despite the fact that he is still unable torecapture with the pawn as this now comes with a tempo on the rook on b1.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3Ppb1n/1qr5/2N1B1PP/PP2QPBK/1RR5 w - - 0 21; Commentary: [%cal Rf5b1]
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3Ppb1n/1qr5/2N1B1PP/PP2QPBK/R1R5 b - - 1 21; Commentary: But what now? g4 is being threatened and itlooks like as if Black will have to retreat one of the two pieces. However,the word retreat did not yet appear in Tal's vocabulary in 1960.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/1qr2n2/2N1B1PP/PP2QPBK/R1R5 w - - 2 22; Commentary: [%cslRf4] A tremendous, typical Tal move, that must have come as a huge shock toBotvinnik. Tal sacrifices a piece in order to kick the bishop on e3 away andcreate a strong pawn on f4 that can be used to disrupt the pieces on the 2ndrank. --- Even though the move is objectively not the best, it must have takenBotvinnik out of the comfort zone as instead of the slow strategic squeeze, hesuddenly has to navigate his way out of the "deep dark forest" - which wasnever an easy task against the like of Mikhail Tal.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3Ppb2/1qr2P2/2N1B2P/PP2QPBK/R1R5 b - - 0 22; Commentary: Of course - theknight has to be accepted.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/1qr2p2/2N4P/PP1BQPBK/R1R5 b - - 1 23; Commentary: This most obvious, natural retreatof the bishop turns out to be a mistake that allows Tal completely back in thegame as it interferes with the queen's defence of the important b2 square.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r2p2/2N4P/Pq1BQPBK/R1R5 w - - 0 24; Commentary: Withthat being said, Tal himself was not completely immune to mistakes in thesewild positions. Here capturing the b2 pawn turns out to be premature.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r2p2/2N4P/Pq1BQPBK/1RR5 b - - 1 24; Commentary: The culmination of the entire battle.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r5/2N2p1P/Pq1BQPBK/1RR5 w - - 0 25; Commentary: Anotherdevilish, typical Tal trick that poses more extremely difficult problems infront of the opponent. The idea is to open the diagonal for the bishop inorder to have a nasty Be5 check available. Alas, as quite often with Tal'scombinations, it turns out that the modern engine points out it is losing -but only in one variation. --- According to Kasparov, the noise in thespectator's hall become so vibrant at this very moment that the unnervedGoldberg - Botvinnik's second - asked for the play to be transferred to anisolated room.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r5/2N2p1P/PR1BQPBK/2R5 b - - 0 25; Commentary: [%cal Rg7a1,Rc8c1] The historic blunderthat largely determined the outcome of the first Botvinnik- Tal match. At theheight of the battle, Botvinnik finally falters under Tal's pressure and aimsto exchange the queens, only to end up in a completely lost position where hispieces will be completely tied up.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r5/2N4P/PR1BpPBK/2R5 w - - 0 26; Commentary: [%cal Rg7a1,Rf5b1,Rc8c1] Suddenly, Black's bishops and rooks arecoordinated wonderfully and the strong passed pawn on e2 is an important asset,as well.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/2r5/1RN4P/P2BpPBK/2R5 b - - 1 26; Commentary: Trying to defend the knight on c3.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/3r4/1RN4P/P2BpPBK/2R5 w - - 2 27; Commentary: [%cal Rc8c3,Gd4d1]A powerful move, threatening the capture on c3 and infiltration on d1.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp4bp/3p2p1/3P1b2/3r4/1RN4P/P3pPBK/2R1B3 b - - 3 27; Commentary: Trying to cover the queening e1 square at all costs.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp5p/3p2p1/3Pbb2/3r4/1RN4P/P3pPBK/2R1B3 w - - 4 28; Commentary: [%cal Re5h2,Ge5f4] A decisiveinclusion of the bishop, that goes to f4.
FEN: 2r3k1/pp5p/3p2p1/3P1b2/3r1b2/1RN4P/P3pPB1/2R1B1K1 w - - 6 29; Commentary: A prosaic and safe wayto win.
FEN: 6k1/pp5p/3p2p1/3P4/3Nbb2/1R5P/P4P2/4rBK1 w - - 2 32; Commentary: And now with the bishop pair, extra pawn and more active pieces,there is no raeson to doubt that Black is completely winning and the rest is amatter of technique for a player of the caliber of Tal.
FEN: 8/7p/3k2p1/3p4/2b2P2/R5bP/6K1/4rB2 w - - 0 43; Commentary: An important tool in the hands of everysuffering chess player when it comes to winning won positions - simplification.Here Tal goes for the rook endgame, correctly judging that the passed c-pawn,supported by the king, will eventually decide the game.
FEN: 8/3R3p/6p1/8/3k1P2/2p3KP/8/4r3 b - - 3 47; Commentary: And here Botvinnik decided to resignwithout even waiting for a reply. If you are unsure why exactly this rookendgame is won - eventually the pawn will cost White a rook, and in themeantime they will be way way too slow with the counterplay on the kingside.If you are unsure about the exact winning technique, I recommend you to checka chapter on endgame for beginners in a book such as Silman's Amateur Mind.--- In any case, this is, for me, one of the most memorable, most fascinatingand most entertaining Tal games of all time. It is maybe not as spectacular assome of his other games, but this is by far the most Tal-like game played atsuch a high level against such a formidable opponent. --- The fact that hemanaged to rattle the great Patriarch with his daring, semi-gambling style ofplay is really something. After this game, Botvinnik also lost the next one.And even though he tried to put up a find by the end of the match and at somepoint even reduced the difference in score to 1, the outcome of the first "Warof the Antipodes" was never really in doubt.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: As mentioned earlier,1.d4 was not really the most common opening move for Tal, but he could, ofcourse, vary as White.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/6B1/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: This variation of the Queen's Indian/Nimzo hybrid is probably not the mostcritical for Black, but it does appear to this day in games of strong players (albeit not that much in the last decade).
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbp2pp1/1p1ppn1p/8/2PP3B/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9; Commentary: So, viathe transposition we have reached some sort of Nimzo-Indian position whereWhite has the bishop pair and Black has the fluent pawn structure andpotential target in the form of the doubled c-pawns. Objectively, White'sdynamic play should always more than compensate for the static weaknesses,although I have personally always found Black's position easier to play inthese types of structures. But I guess it is a matter of taste.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbp2pp1/1p1ppn1p/8/2PP3B/2P1P3/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9; Commentary: Moving the knight is a standard plan - the idea is to prepare f3-e4 pawn pushand establish a big center.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbp2pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/2PP3B/2P1P3/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: Black usually counters this idea with acentral expansion of their own.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbp2pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/2PP3B/2P1PP2/P2N2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: All according to the plan, although this is definitely not the only way ofcontinuing in this position.
FEN: rn2k2r/pbp1qpp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/2PPP2B/2P2P2/P2N2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11; Commentary: Now we have this typical stare-offcontest between the pawns on e4 and e5. On one hand White has gained somespace and restricted the bishop on b7 - on the other hand, the doubled pawnson the c-file are now even weakes as the center has potentially lost somemobility.
FEN: r3kn1r/pbp1qpp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/2PPP2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 13; Commentary: [%csl Rf4][%cal Gf8g6,Gf8e6,Re6f4] A goodmaneuver. The knight is heading to g6 to gain a tempo on the bishop and thenit will also eye the f4 square.
FEN: r3kn1r/pbp1qpp1/1p1p1n1p/2P1p3/3PP2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 13; Commentary: This move, undoubling the pawns andgetting rid of the potential weakness is very typical, but not strictlynecessary and probably a bit too hasty here. White will end up losing a pawnfor questionable compensation.
FEN: r3kn1r/pbp1qpp1/1p3n1p/2p1P3/4P2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 14; Commentary: This move is objectively bad as it simply loses a pawn for no compensation,although it does open the position for the two bishops.
FEN: r3kn1r/pbp2pp1/1p3n1p/2p1q3/4P2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 15; Commentary: [%calRe5c3] Now the queen is centralized and exerting strong pressure on the c3pawn, while the pieces on the d-file are also a bit loose. White is alreadysignificantly worse, objectively speaking.
FEN: r3kn1r/pbp2pp1/1p3n1p/2p1q3/Q3P2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 15; Commentary: This check tries todisrupt Black's forces.
FEN: r3kn1r/pb3pp1/1pp2n1p/2p1q3/Q3P2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 16; Commentary: And Hecht immediately goes wrong. The problem ofthis move is not so much that the bishop on b7 is blocked - but more that thed6 square has been weakened. We will see its significance very, very soon.
FEN: r3kn1r/pb3pp1/1pp2n1p/2p1q3/Q3P2B/2PB1P2/P2N2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 16; Commentary: [%csl Rd6][%cal Gd2c4,Rc4d6] Hechtprobably missed this. Now Nc4 is coming next almost irrespective of what Blackdoes.
FEN: r3k2r/pb3pp1/1pp2nnp/2p1q3/Q1N1P2B/2PB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 17; Commentary: [%cal Rc4e5] A nice intermezzo, gaining a tempo on the queen.
FEN: r3k2r/pb3pp1/1pp1qnnp/2p1P3/Q1N4B/2PB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 18; Commentary: Another powerful move, trying to keep the king in the center of the board.
FEN: r3k2r/pb3pp1/2p1qnnp/1pp1P3/Q1N4B/2PB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 19; Commentary: A tricky counterstrike and absolutely the best move in the position, creatinga total mess in the position, with half of the board hanging.
FEN: r3k2r/pb3pp1/2p1qPnp/1pp5/Q1N4B/2PB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 19; Commentary: A legendary move that made this game famous. According to Tal himself, at thisexact point, legendary grandmaster Miguel Najdorf who was watching the game,approached him and kissed him. This ultra brilliant move is just so incrediblybeautiful and it is really a pity it is not the best move in this position,objectively speaking.
FEN: r3k2r/pb3pp1/2p1qPnp/2p5/p1N4B/2PB1P2/P5PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 20; Commentary: Of course - what can be more naturalthan capturing the queen. However, now Tal unleashes another very famouscombination!
FEN: r3k1r1/pb3pP1/2p1q1np/2p2B2/p1N4B/2P2P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b q - 2 21; Commentary: The point of Tal'scombination! Instead of moving the attacked piece, Tal leaves two more enprise and attacks the queen, but it transpires that Black can't really takethe knight on c4 or the bishop on f5.
FEN: r3k1r1/pb3pP1/2p1q2p/2p2B2/p1N4n/2P2P2/P5PP/R4RK1 w q - 0 22; Commentary: Ignoring the threat to the queenand taking the bishop is a legitimate defense - although the engine points outan even stronger, more paradoxical attempt.
FEN: r5r1/p3kpP1/b1pNB2p/2p5/p6n/2P2P2/P5PP/R4RK1 w - - 3 24; Commentary: Now itseems as if White is losing a piece, but there is a nice intermezzo available.
FEN: r5r1/p3kpP1/b1pN3p/2p5/p1B4n/2P2P2/P5PP/R4RK1 b - - 4 24; Commentary: Attacking the bishop on a6 and saving a piece as Black is unable tocapture both hanging pieces at the same time!
FEN: r7/p4pr1/B1pk3p/2p5/p6n/2P2PP1/P6P/R4RK1 b - - 0 26; Commentary: As usual in chess, after a lot of fireworks, we have reached a technicalendgame where White has some chances due to the better pawn structure - butalso due to the fact the bishop is usually stronger than the knight inpositions with pawns on the both sides of the board. --- With best play itshould probably be a draw, but as anyone who has ever met Magnus Carlsen overthe board knows - there is a big difference between an equallish and a drawnposition. It is actually remarkable how quickly the game went downhil forHecht from this point.
FEN: r7/p4pr1/B1pk3p/2p2n2/p7/2P2PP1/P6P/R4RK1 w - - 1 27; Commentary: This is probably a serious mistake already. Theknight was not threatened yet and yet Black willingly spends a tempo moving itand removing the attack on the f3 pawn.
FEN: r7/p4pr1/B1pk3p/2p2n2/p7/2P2PP1/P6P/1R3RK1 b - - 2 27; Commentary: Now White seizes the open file for his ownrook and creates some fresh ideas of Rb7.
FEN: r7/p5r1/B1pk1p1p/2p2n2/p7/2P2PP1/P6P/1R3RK1 w - - 0 28; Commentary: But this move is just anoutright blunder that virtually loses the game on the spot as it opens the 7thrank. However, Black's defence was already a bit trickier than on the previousmove.
FEN: r7/p5r1/B1pk1p1p/2p2n2/p7/2P2PP1/P6P/1R1R2K1 b - - 1 28; Commentary: Now Black is in gigantictrouble as all White's pieces are active and Black's forces are completelyuncoordinated.
FEN: r7/p3k1r1/B1p2p1p/2p2n2/p7/2P2PP1/P6P/1R2R1K1 b - - 3 29; Commentary: It is a bit surprising that Tal didn't take thepawn on c6 here.
FEN: r7/p5r1/B1pk1p1p/5n2/p1p5/2P2PP1/P4K1P/1R2R3 w - - 0 31; Commentary: The idea of this move isto open up the c5 square for the king but also to secure the d5 square for theknight.
FEN: r7/p5r1/B1pk1p1p/5n2/p1p3P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/1R2R3 b - - 0 31; Commentary: A reasonable move,chasing the knight away. But the problem is that the knight is now forced tooccupy a better square - one on d5.
FEN: r7/pR2n1r1/B1pk1p1p/8/p1p3P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 b - - 2 32; Commentary: This actuallyrelinquishes a big part of White's advantage as it allows Black a surprisingdefensive resource.
FEN: 6r1/pR2n1r1/B1pk1p1p/8/p1p3P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 w - - 3 33; Commentary: [%csl Gh6][%cal Rg8g2,Gf6f5] It is very surprising to double the rooks on thesemi-closed file, but Black now has concrete ideas of undermining thestructure with h5 and f5 and trying to infiltrate.
FEN: 6r1/pR2n1r1/2pk1p1p/8/p1B3P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 b - - 0 33; Commentary: Only now doesWhite take the pawn, but now it happens under the inferior circumstances.
FEN: 6r1/p5r1/3k1p1p/3p4/pR4P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 b - - 1 35; Commentary: It was already very difficult to win the position, butthis allows Black to simplify immediately.
FEN: 2r5/p5r1/3k1p1p/3p4/pR4P1/2P2P2/P4K1P/4R3 w - - 2 36; Commentary: But tis move is a big mistake as Black misses the bestopportunity to exchange some pawns and create the threat of the counterplay.
FEN: 8/p5r1/5R1p/2kp4/6P1/2r2P2/P4K1P/4R3 b - - 0 38; Commentary: Now Black loses a few vital pawns and White ends upwith two connected passed pawns on the kingside. The rest is not of particularinterest as Tal went on to convert the advantage smoothly.
FEN: 8/p7/6P1/6R1/3p1K2/5P2/P1k5/6r1 b - - 3 49; Commentary: A fascinating game, featuring a lot ofinstructive opening innacuraccies, a fabulous middlegame skirmish/combinationand also a very instructive endgame. It may not be one of Tal's most accurategames, but the aesthetic value of the combination started with 19.exf6 is whathas etched it in my heart and the chess history books forever.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: According to Kasparov, this was one of the very firsttimes that Portisch played the Caro-Kann.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2; Commentary: We have previously seen howTal chose the rare setup in his 1959 Candidates game against Smyslov. Here, heopts for the Two Knights Variation, which is a very big and respectablevariation nowadays - but which I feel was not the most mainstream opening lineat the time when this game was played.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4p3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: Kasparov mentionedthat this is not the most accurate, but it is the 2nd most common move in thisposition.
FEN: rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4N1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: Only this move is somewhat imprecise, as it is usually better toeither develop the bishop OR to capture on e4 - but not both.
FEN: rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4N3/5Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: In thisvariation, White simply has the advantage of the bishop pair, although Black'spawn structure is very solid as it is lacking weaknesses, which is one of thereasons why so many players are attracted to this Caro-Kann structures.
FEN: r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/8/3PQ3/2PB3P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 11; Commentary: A typical scenario for thestructure where the d4 pawn is facing the pawns on e6 and c6 has arisen. Whitehas a bit more space and the bishop pair, but Black is very solid - especiallysince two pairs of minor pieces have already been exchanged (which alsobenefits the side with less space). --- With that being said, White shouldobjectively be better here. The general idea is to be patient, and increasethe space advantage both on the queenside and on the kingside, by pushing thepawns, although it has to be prepared and timed correctly. ---
FEN: r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/3P3Q/2PB3P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 12; Commentary: A very aggressive post for the queen, trying to stay close to the king and thekingside.
FEN: r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3n4/3P3Q/2PB3P/PP3PP1/R1B2RK1 w kq - 3 13; Commentary: It was perfectly possible to castle, but Portisch wanted tobring the pieces to more active squares first.
FEN: r3k2r/pp3ppp/1qp1pb2/3n4/3P2Q1/2PB3P/PP3PP1/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 7 15; Commentary: A little bit too optimistic. Portisch delays castling for yet another move andtries to pin the bishop on c1 to the defence of the pawn on b2. However, thequeen doesn't really belong on b6 here and it was once again better to simplycastle.
FEN: r3k2r/pp3ppp/1qp1pb2/3n4/2PP2Q1/3B3P/PP3PP1/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 0 15; Commentary: A very aggressive, typical Tal continuation. He wants tochase the enemy knight from the strong central post on d5. Usually, this movehas to be carefully timed as in many cases the pawn on d4 can turn out to beweak, but here Tal had concrete attacking ideas in mind.
FEN: r3k2r/pp3ppp/1qp1pb2/8/1nPP2Q1/3B3P/PP3PP1/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 1 16; Commentary: Now what? Isn't White just losing the pawn on d4?
FEN: r3k2r/pp3ppp/1qp1Rb2/8/1nPP2Q1/3B3P/PP3PP1/R1B3K1 b kq - 0 16; Commentary: A tremendous idea, sacrifing a full rook for theattack on the king that has overstayed the welcome in the center of the board.At first glance, this might seem extremely suspicious as White only has thequeen around the king, the bishop on d3 is under the attack and the entirequeenside is undeveloped. However, Tal tries to make an argument that theterrible position of the opponent's king will provide him with more thanenough opportunity to bring in the reserve and attack it. --- Objectivelyspeaking, this sacrifice shouldn't be sufficient for more than a draw,although as usual in Tal games, the objective evaluation is not of primaryimportance. It has to be said this displays an amazing boldness - rememberthat this was the second game of a Candidates match!
FEN: r3k2r/pp4pp/1qp1Qb2/8/1nPP4/3B3P/PP3PP1/R1B3K1 b kq - 0 17; Commentary: Blackhas three possible ways of dealing with the check and every one of them shouldbe examined.
FEN: r4k1r/pp4pp/1qp1Qb2/8/1nPP4/3B3P/PP3PP1/R1B3K1 w - - 1 18; Commentary: With this move, the king goes into the more dangerous sideof the board.

FEN: 3r1k1r/pp4pp/1qp1Qb2/2P5/3P1B2/3n3P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Black is forced to give up the queen.
FEN: 3r1k1r/Pp4pp/2p2b2/3n4/3P2Q1/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 b - - 0 22; Commentary: Thus, the dust has settled and White has aqueen and two pawns for the bishop, knight and the rook. However, the pawn ona7 is very dangerous and Black's pieces are sorely lacking in coordination -so he already has to find the only defence to stay alive.
FEN: 3r3r/Pp2k1pp/2p2b2/3n4/3P2Q1/7P/PP3PP1/R5K1 w - - 1 23; Commentary: Poritsch wrotethat he saw the move g6, but though this is good enough as he saw that thechecks by heavy pieces are not as dangerous. However, he overlooked a strongreply that Tal, naturally finds!
FEN: 3r3r/Pp2k1pp/2p2b2/3n4/1P1P2Q1/7P/P4PP1/R5K1 b - - 0 23; Commentary: A verystrong move, overlooked by Portisch. The pawn goes like a battering ram to b5in order to open up Black's queenside and lines leading to the enemy monarch.
FEN: r6r/Pp2k1pp/2p2b2/3n4/1P1P2Q1/7P/P4PP1/R5K1 w - - 1 24; Commentary: Trying to eliminate the pesky a-pawn.
FEN: r6r/Pp4pp/2pk1b2/1P1n4/3P2Q1/7P/P4PP1/4R1K1 b - - 0 25; Commentary: The point behind playing b4 earlier. Now this pawn is threatening to take onc6 or to land on b6, in either case with decisive effect.
FEN: 7r/rp4pp/2pk1b2/1P1n4/3P2Q1/7P/P4PP1/4R1K1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: A finalblunder in a lost position.
FEN: 7r/rpk3pp/2p2R2/1P1n4/3P2Q1/7P/P4PP1/6K1 b - - 0 27; Commentary: [%cal Rg4g7] And due to the threat of Qxg7, Portisch decided to resign. Atremendous attack and vintage Tal - initiative at all costs. I should probablyadd that Tal went on to defeat Portisch convincingly in the quarter-final -then also Larsen in the semi-final after finally losing to Spassky in thefinal match, thus confirming that his 1960 World Championship run was morethan just a fluke.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1; Commentary: A rare occurrence for Tal - opening with the Retiwas not something he did every day
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: But the game very quicklytransposes to the English opening...
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 9; Commentary: ...and then to one of the main variations of theTarrasch Defence. This opening used to be very popular in the past (Kasparovfamously used it with great effect in his own path to the World ChampionshipMatch), although nowadays it is not seen that often at the top level due tothe strategic risk the isolated pawn involves (and due to the fact morereliable neutralizing options are available at Black's disposal). --- Still,it is a very reputable opening and especially popular at club level, so it isnot a bad thing to see a game or two Model games in it if you are a 1.d4player.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3p4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10; Commentary: To be honest, I always though this voluntary capture on d4 issomewhat premature, but now I see it is the most commonly played move in thisposition, so what do I exactly know.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10; Commentary: Now we obtain a typicalposition for the Tarrasch Defence, where Black has an isolated pawn but oftenobtains reasonable dynamic chances in return.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/3p4/3N4/1QN1B1P1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 b - - 3 12; Commentary: Thismove increases the pressure on the d5 pawn and basically forces Black's nextmove. I am not 100% sure if it is beneficial to bring the knight closer to thejuicy c4 square, even if this is the 2nd most common move in this position (have I mentioned I don't know that much at all about the Tarrasch Defence)?
FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp2bpp1/5n1p/n2p4/3N4/2N1B1P1/PPQ1PPBP/R4RK1 b - - 5 13; Commentary: [%cal Gc2f5] I guess one of the ideas behind having the queen onc2 is to be able to jump to f5 with the knight.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp2bpp1/5n1p/n2p4/3N2b1/2N1B1P1/PPQ1PPBP/R4RK1 w - - 6 14; Commentary: Another very typicalTarrasch Defence move, pressuring the potentially weak e2 square andactivating the light -squared bishop.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp2bpp1/5n1p/n2p4/3N2b1/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PPB1/R4RK1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: [%cal Rh3g4] Immediately posinga question to the bishop.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp1bbpp1/5n1p/n2p4/3N4/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PPB1/R4RK1 w - - 1 15; Commentary: The bishop is a bit passive here and it blocksthe queen's communication with the d5 pawn so it can be labeled as aninaccuracy.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp1bbpp1/5n1p/n2p4/3N4/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PPB1/3R1RK1 b - - 2 15; Commentary: Bringing the piecesin play and planning to siege the isolated pawn.
FEN: 2rqrbk1/pp1b1pp1/5n1p/n2B1N2/8/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PP2/3R1RK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: Finally, the isolated pawn falls, but this is not the end of the world asBlack still has a lot of activity, potentially.
FEN: 2rq1bk1/pp1b1pp1/5n1p/n2BrN2/8/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PP2/3R1RK1 w - - 1 18; Commentary: [%cal Re5f5,Re5d5]But this move, naively hoping to win a piece by the means of a double attack,is a serious mistake as it overlooks a relatively basic tactic available atWhite's disposal.
FEN: 2rq1bk1/pp1b1pp1/5n1N/n2Br3/8/2N1B1PP/PPQ1PP2/3R1RK1 b - - 0 18; Commentary: [%cal Ra2g8,Gc2g6] An "obvious" piece sacrifice,intending to use the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal to the maximum effect. Qg6 iscoming next.
FEN: 2rq1bk1/pp1b1p2/5nQp/n2Br3/8/2N1B1PP/PP2PP2/3R1RK1 b - - 1 19; Commentary: [%cal Rg6f7,Rd5f7] The point of the combinationwas to utilize the pin to infiltrate with the queen and collect the f7 pawn aswell.
FEN: 2rq1b1k/pp1b1B2/5nQp/n3r3/8/2N1B1PP/PP2PP2/3R1RK1 b - - 0 20; Commentary: Now h6 is also weak and Black should be dead lost,objectively, although quite a few adventures lie in front of us.
FEN: 3q1b1k/pp1b1B2/2r2nQp/n3r3/8/2N1B1PP/PP2PP2/3R1RK1 w - - 1 21; Commentary: [%calGc6h6] Trying to cover the 6th rank laterally.
FEN: 3q1b1k/pp1b1B2/2r2nQp/n2Rr3/8/2N1B1PP/PP2PP2/5RK1 b - - 2 21; Commentary: But this is a bittoo flashy. Tal overlooks a very powerful defensive resources available toBlack in this position.
FEN: 5b1k/pp1bqB2/2r2nQp/n2Rr3/8/2N1B1PP/PP2PP2/5RK1 w - - 3 22; Commentary: Returning the favour, although itis not surprising that Black goes wrong in such a complicated and dangerousposition. Also, it is very understandable that Black wanted to sidestep thepotential pin on the d-file.
FEN: 5b1k/pp1bqB2/2r2nQp/n2Rr3/3B4/2N3PP/PP2PP2/5RK1 b - - 4 22; Commentary: [%cal Rd4h8]Now everything is hanging on the long diagonal and Black doesn't have time toplace the bishop on g7 - the rook on e5 is hanging!

FEN: 7k/pp1bqBb1/2r2nQp/3Rr3/2nB1P2/2N3PP/PP2P3/5RK1 w - - 1 24; Commentary: Nothing else works - the rook can't move becauseof the previously seen mating threat on g8. Black is forced to give up theextra material and end up in a totally lost position.
FEN: 5q1k/pp1b2b1/2r2nQp/4R3/5P2/1BN3PP/PP2P3/5RK1 b - - 2 26; Commentary: Now White is an exchange and three pawns up, so the conversionisn't particularly difficult.
FEN: 5q1k/pp1b2b1/2r4p/4P3/8/1BNQ2PP/PP2P3/5RK1 b - - 0 28; Commentary: Okay, sorry, onlythree pawns up as Black has just regained the exchange - but the outcome isnever in doubt all the same.
FEN: 4b2k/pp4b1/3rP2p/2q5/4Q3/1BN3PP/PP2P2K/5R2 b - - 2 31; Commentary: And hereStean finally decided to throw in the towel. A powerful, very convincingvictory (despite the slight error on move 21 ) that was mainly the result ofsuspicious opening play by his opponent.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: Back to old loves in the old age?
FEN: r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3; Commentary: As Kasparov wrotesomewhere - "The ability to handle different structures that result from theRuy Lopez is what determins the class of a certain player". It is no wondermost World Champions played the Ruy with at least one colour - and Tal was noexception.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 10; Commentary: The Chigorin variation of the Closed Ruy Lopez is one of the oldest systems atBlack's disposal in this complex opening that has been played on all levelsfor more than 100 years. These days, it is not the most frequent guest at thehighest level as there are other, more reliable systems available to Black,but for average patzers like you and me, there is a very high probability weare going to encounter it sooner or later if we play 1.e4, 2.Nf3, 3.Bb5 and 4.Ba4.
FEN: r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 12; Commentary: This is the old way of handling thisvariation.
FEN: r4rk1/2qbbppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 13; Commentary: One of the numerous possibilities at Black's disposal in this system.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/3PP3/4NN1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 15; Commentary: [%cal Ge3c4,Ge3f5,Ge3d5,Ge3c2] The knight is veryagile on e3, covering the important c4 square, defending the bishop on c2 andpotentially eyeing the d5 and f5 squares.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/4NN1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 16; Commentary: A typical Chigorin maneuver.The knight puts pressure on the d4 pawn and intends to go to b4 after Whitecloses the center, in order to harass the bishop on c2.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbppp/3p1n2/pp1Pp3/1n2P3/4NN1P/PP3PP1/RBBQR1K1 w - - 0 18; Commentary: [%csl Gc5][%cal Gb4a6,Gb5b4,Ga6c5] One of the ideas behind Black's setup isthis queenside expansion. They want to get the moves a5-b4 and then securelyland the knight on c5.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbppp/n2p1n2/pp1Pp3/1P2P3/P3NN1P/5PP1/RBBQR1K1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: A very nice tactical way ofpreventing Black from executing this plan. Remember this idea of playing b4 inthis type of structure as it happens very often in the Ruy.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/n2p1np1/pp1Pp3/1P2P3/P3NN1P/5PP1/RBBQR1K1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: This move isa common idea in different Ruy Lopez structures. Sometimes, it leads to thefianchetto of the bishop via f8-g7 route, but sometimes the knight can alsoappear on this square.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/n2p1np1/pp1Pp3/1P2P3/P3NN1P/3B1PP1/RB1QR1K1 b - - 1 20; Commentary: Now White obtains a very typical advantage in this type of variationbecause he has a big space advantage and the knight on a6 is completely out ofthe game. However, Black's position is very sturdy and solid and it takes agreat player to outmaneuver and outplay Black from a position as this.
FEN: 2r2rk1/2qbbp1p/n2p1np1/1p1Pp3/1p2P3/P3NN1P/3B1PP1/RB1QR1K1 w - - 0 21; Commentary: White was potentially threatening to take on a5, so Black avoids this option,even though it does open the a-file.
FEN: 2r2rk1/1q1bbp1p/n2p1np1/1p1Pp3/1P2P3/3BNN1P/3B1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 22; Commentary: [%csl Rb5] Anotherfeature of this position is the weakness of the b5 pawn which White canutilize when maneuvering the pieces.

FEN: 2r2rk1/1qnbbp1p/3p1np1/1p1Pp3/1P2P3/3B1N1P/2NB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 4 23; Commentary: The knight on e3 has finally done itsjob and now it moves out of the way to free the bishop on d2 to seek a morepromising role.
FEN: 2r2rk1/1qnbbp1p/3p2p1/1p1Pp2n/1P2P3/3B1N1P/2NB1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 5 24; Commentary: [%cal Gh5f4,Gf7f5] Black has to create counterplay onthe kingside - either with the Nf4 knight jump or with the f5 pawn push.
FEN: 2r2rk1/1qnbbp1p/3p2p1/1p1Pp2n/1P2P3/3BBN1P/2N2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 6 24; Commentary: White decides to ignore it and threaten Ra7 for now, although it is not100% clear whether the bishop is better placed on e3 or d2 (given that on e3it can be hit with the f-pawn). There are other alternatives, but thecharacter of the position remains the same nevertheless.
FEN: 5rk1/1qnbbp1p/3p2p1/1p1Pp2n/1P2P3/3BBN1P/2NQ1PP1/r3R1K1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: It is logical for Black to try and exchange some pieces when they have lessspace.
FEN: 5rk1/1qnbbp1p/3p2p1/1p1Pp2n/1P2P3/3BBN1P/3Q1PP1/N3R1K1 b - - 0 26; Commentary: An unconventional decision (how many of us wouldautomatically recapture with the rook)? But White wants to bring the knight tob3 square and then potentially eye the a5 or even the c5 square (spoiler alert).
FEN: 5rk1/1qnbb2p/3p2p1/1p1Ppp1n/1P2P3/3BBN1P/3Q1PP1/N3R1K1 w - - 0 27; Commentary: [%cal Gf5f4] Finally Black initiaties counterplay at the moment whenour queen is locking the bishop and when f4 is actually a threat.

FEN: 5rk1/1qnbb1np/3p2pB/1p1Ppp2/1P2P3/3B1N1P/3Q1PP1/N3R1K1 w - - 2 28; Commentary: But this move is actually very passive and totally misguided. Theknight was very decent on h5 and it was absolutely not necessary to move it.Hjartarson was maybe considering a kingside attack with f4 and so on, but thisis a wrong idea in this position.
FEN: 5rk1/1qnbb1np/3p2pB/1p1Pp3/1P2Pp2/1N1B1N1P/3Q1PP1/4R1K1 w - - 0 29; Commentary: Closing down the position, inmy opinion, only helps White as now the counterplay on the kingside is nothappening any time soon and it is unrealistic to expect any sort of King'sIndian pawn storm with g5-g4 given the current positioning of the pieces.

The idea is very simple - either the pawn on b5 falls - or the pawn ond6 is diverted from the defence of the e5 pawn. One of those rare cases whereTal's sacrifice was very positionally founded - and very correct :).

A fascinating game and one of the rare examples where Tal'scombinations had a strictly positional foundation. --- On the other hand,apart from the splendid combination, I also found Tal's handling of a typicalSpanish middlegame extremely instructive. We often admire his combinations andtend to forget he was also a very well-rounded player with above averagepositional understanding.

FEN: r1bqkb1r/2p3pp/p7/2ppPp2/4n3/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 11; Commentary: White has a simple Nf4move, thraetening the d5 and also Qh5, and it is not easy to defend againstthat
FEN: r1bqkb1r/7p/p1p3p1/2ppPp2/2P1nN2/8/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Very instructive. Whitehas the initiative and continues to play energeticaly. Keres was very strongwhen he had the tactical initiative

FEN: 4b3/q3b3/p1p4k/Q1p1Np2/2Pp1Pp1/1P1N2Pp/P2B4/6K1 b - - 7 44; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A very convincing victory,although it has to be said that Reshevsky's openings were always the weakestpoint in his inventory.
FEN: r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 5 6; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Theso-called Worall attack. White defends the e-pawn with his queen, frees the d1square for his rook and plans Rd1-c3-d4.  The main drawback of the move isthat the Queen is slightly exposed on this square, and Bg4 move is alwaysslightly annoying for White
FEN: r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/P3P3/1B3N2/1PPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this is veryrare move, even from today's perspective

FEN: r2q1rk1/1b1n1ppp/p4b2/2pPp3/8/1BP5/P2NQPPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 2 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] White has a strong passed pawn, outposts on e4 and c4 for theknight and a healthier pawn structure. We will comment the rest of the gameonly with brief notes.
FEN: r2q1rk1/1b1nbppp/8/p1pPN3/8/1BP5/P3QPPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 0 18; Commentary: Probably it was notneccessary to hurry with this capture.
FEN: 3Q3R/5pp1/6k1/p1q4p/2p4P/2P2P2/P4P2/6K1 b - - 0 41; Commentary: [pgndiagram] I think that this game is a very good example of how theart of the defence in chess developed. I think that a modern grandmaster wouldhave put much tougher resistance then Keres, even after reaching an unpleasantposition right in the opening.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Quite suprisingly, Keres decides to serve from the left,and deviate from his favourite e4 move.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9; Commentary: [pgndiagram] In my humble opinion,Keres' opening choice wasn't the best for this game. Smyslov has easydevelopment and there aren't many tactical opportunities, which have alwaysbeen Keres' forte.  Or at least there should not have been any
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1nPP4/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/2RQRBK1 b - - 9 13; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Keeping the c4 pawn defended. White wouldlike to go 13 Bb1 here, but that simply drops a pawn

FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1p/1p2pbp1/7R/2pP4/PP5R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: A fantasticand well calculated defense. Smyslov keeps his nerve and proves that he wasthe better player at that particular moment.  The main point of this move isthat now Black's bishop can come to e4 and cement the kingside structuretogether.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1R/1p2pbp1/8/3P4/PPp4R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 w - - 0 21; Commentary: Cutting the defence of thepawn on d4. Now the h8 square is critical, but Black is just in time to bringhis pieces to defend it.
FEN: 2r2rk1/pb3p1R/1p2pbp1/8/3q4/PPp4R/1B3PPP/2Q2BK1 w - - 0 22; Commentary: [pgndiagram] There is no attack now,and the rest of the game doesn't require further commentary.

White keepsthe option of attacking White's king, by some sort of Qd1-Qf3-f5 maneovre. IfBlack plays g6, than there is possibility of h4-h5.   But all these ideas lookrisky for White

FEN: 7k/6pp/1p6/p6Q/P3r2P/6P1/1b3P2/6K1 b - - 0 40; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now White's task is somewhatcomplicated. He has to advance his kingside pawns under favourablecircumstances, while not giving up his a4 pawn. If Black plays h6, thanWhite's king can go to f7 and participate in mating attack

FEN: 2q1r1kr/pp3pp1/3b2n1/2pp2Pp/3P3P/1P2PN1b/PBPQ2B1/R4RK1 w - - 1 25; Commentary: It is the weakness of the square that matters, not the square itself

FEN: 4r1kr/pp3pp1/6n1/2ppP1Pp/6qP/1P2P3/PBP3Q1/R4RK1 w - - 1 28; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Notbad. MVL choses a technical continuation, resulting in a winning endgame
FEN: 4r1kr/pp3pp1/8/2pRP1P1/6p1/1P2Pn2/PBP5/5RK1 w - - 1 31; Commentary: This endgame is close to winning forBlack though. Those pawns on g5,e5 and e3 really make a sad impression
FEN: 4r1k1/pp3pp1/8/2pRP1n1/6p1/1P2P3/PB3K2/8 w - - 0 35; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Now only precisionfrom Black is required. The remainder requires only brief commentary.

FEN: 8/2R1P1p1/5nk1/2p1K3/8/4P3/8/4r3 w - - 1 55; Commentary: A very interesting and tense game. Unfortunately for Rapport, I thinkthat it is in this kind of tactical positions that MVL excels, and this timehe hit the rock with his approach. But kudos for bravery and entertaining usall nevertheless.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3; Commentary: Here we go. The Chigorin defence is rarely seen on toplevel, if we disregard the games of Richard Rapport.
FEN: r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/3P4/5b2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Necessary exchange, getting rid of one defender of the d4 pawn

It is obvious that White is better, due to the open b-file,massive centre and bishop pair. I think it goes without saying that White hasemerged better out of the opening.
FEN: r3k1nr/pppq1ppp/2n5/4p3/3P4/2P1PP2/P2B1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] A new move. I am notentirely certain of the reasons behind this move. I guess Black's idea is togo for the queenside castling without leaving the h7 pawn hanging.
FEN: 2kr2nr/pppq1ppp/2n5/4p3/3P4/2P1PP2/P2B1PBP/1R1QK2R b K - 4 11; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Nakamura goes for thelogical development without trying to be too smart. I have noticed that he hasadjusted his style to be more solid in the last couple of years.

FEN: 2kr1r2/p1pqn1pp/1pn5/4p3/2QP4/2P1PP2/P2B1PBP/1R2K2R b K - 2 14; Commentary: [pgndiagram] It is doubtful whetherBlack has full compensation for the pawn. White has no weaknesses, and he onlyneeds to complete his development to be completely comfortable. I think thatRapport's opening experiment has failed
FEN: 1k1r1r2/p1pqn2p/1pn5/4p1p1/2QP4/2P1PP2/P2B1PBP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Actually, in hindsight,it is only with this move that the tide definitely turns toward Nakamura.
FEN: 1k1r1r2/p1pqn2p/1pn5/1R2p1p1/2QP4/2P1PP2/P2B1PBP/5RK1 b - - 1 16; Commentary: Now Black doesn't have the samepositional pressure as in 15... Ng6 variation. This move threatens f4 wheneverBlack moves the e7 knight

FEN: r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p4p/3p3n/3P3B/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 6 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] Herewe go. This move has become standard in various positions of the Carlsbadstructure. Black exchanges dark squared bishops and liberates his positionsomewhat  I remember GM Bogdan Lalic commenting that similar positions arerock solid for Black and that it is hard to play for the win

FEN: 3r1rk1/pp2qpp1/1np4p/8/2nPP1b1/1PNB2N1/P6P/2Q1RRK1 w - - 1 21; Commentary: [pgndiagram] The very first moveafter the acceptance of the sacrifice turns out to be a serious mistake. Blackdecides to give up a piece, but he shouldn't have real compensation
FEN: 3r1rk1/pp3pp1/2p4p/5P2/2Pq4/2N5/P6P/2Q1RR1K b - - 1 25; Commentary: [pgndiagram] So Black has sacrificed a piece and has some counter chancesbased on the weak pawns and the weak White king. But still, Idoubt that thecompensation is sufficient

FEN: rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: [pgndiagram] But this is a slight surprise. White choses the old mainline, which is what MVL also did.

FEN: rn3r1k/pp3p2/2pq4/5Q2/2BP1b2/2P5/P4PP1/R3R2K w - - 1 21; Commentary: Trying to organize the defence but Black doesn't have effective way of doingso

FEN: rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2pn4/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: [pgndiagram] In his book, TheRevolution of the 70s, Garry Kasparov claimed that this move is bad. But itseems like modern players have their own opinions
FEN: rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2pn4/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10; Commentary: This move is slightly mysterious to me, to be honest.

FEN: r4rk1/pbqnbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3P3B/P1NB1N2/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 16; Commentary: [pgndiagram] This is slightly unpleasant for Black, since the bishop is comingto g3 with tempo.

FEN: 1r2kb1r/2Nq1pp1/2Qp3p/1p4B1/4P3/1P6/1P3PPP/6K1 b k - 3 23; Commentary: A brutal miniature that very few would associate withSmyslov if the moves were shown without the names! Beautiful demonstration ofseveral important concepts - how to utilize the lead in development, how todestroy a seemingly healthy pawn chain with some nice tactical ideas, how tohandle the initiative and so on.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: In his youth, Smyslov very oftenmoved the king pawn forward, but this move isn't only restricted to his youth.For example, he ventured it in his World Championship Matches against MikhailBotvinnik, among other things.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: This moveleads to the so-called Steinitz variation of the Ruy Lopez - a line that wasvery popular back in the day due to its solidity. Black reinforces the e5point and has various developing scheme to follow it up available.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: But this move, involving a sharp pawn sacrifice, is definitely not the mostcommon continuation nor the one you would expect from "harmonic andpositional" Smyslov. White strikes in the center immediately, but thisessentially gambits a pawn.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p2p4/1p6/3pP3/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: Since Whitecan't really regain the pawn on d4 at once due to the exposed bishop on b3, hehas to gambit a pawn in some way. Playing c3, undermining the center andaiming for rapid development is one possible way of doing so.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p2p4/1p6/4P3/1Bp5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9; Commentary: Black accepts the challenge, which is probably the mostprincipled way of playing.
FEN: r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p2p4/1p5Q/4P3/1Bp5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 9; Commentary: [%csl Gd5][%cal Rh5f7,Gb1c3,Gc3d5] Withthis move, White tries to create pressure against the f7 pawn while at thesame time keeping the route Nc3-Nd5 open for the knight on b1. However, thisshouldn't be too brilliant as the queen on h5 is very exposed.
FEN: r1b1kbnr/2p1qppp/p2p4/1p5Q/4P3/1Bp5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 10; Commentary: [%cslRe7][%cal Re7e4,Ge7f7] It is very natural to place the queen on e7, defend thef7 pawn and attack the e4 pawn, but it transpires that her majesty is notideally placed here as it gets in the way of the kingside pieces.
FEN: r1b1kb1r/2p1qppp/p2p1n2/1p6/4P3/1BN5/PP2QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 11; Commentary: [%csl Rf6,Rf8,Rg7] Now White has some compensation as it is not supereasy for Black to develop the kingside.
FEN: r3kb1r/4qppp/p1ppbn2/1p6/4P3/1BN5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 13; Commentary: With this move, Blackdefends the d5 square and tries to stay solid, but this is somewhat passive asit allows White to bring in more pieces into fray. Furthermore, it willtranspire that this pawn can become a target and allow some hidden tacticalpossibilities later in the game.
FEN: r3kb1r/4qppp/p1ppbn2/1p4B1/4P3/1BN5/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13; Commentary: [%cal Rg5d8,Gc3d5] Bringing the bishop into the game andcreating some ideas of Bxf6 and Nd5.
FEN: r3kb1r/4qppp/p1pp1n2/1p4B1/4P3/1bN5/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 14; Commentary: Probably the best move, reducing the effect of theND5 sacrifice a great deal.
FEN: r3kb1r/5ppp/p1ppqn2/1p4B1/4P3/1PN5/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 15; Commentary: But this is adecisive mistake as the queen departs from the defence of the c6 pawn andallows a nice combination we are about to see.
FEN: r3kb1r/5ppp/p1ppqn2/1p4B1/4P3/1PN5/1PQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 15; Commentary: [%cal Rc3b5] Now this attack on c6 and b5 is decisive as Black hasno good defence.

FEN: 5rk1/6p1/p4q1p/1ppp2N1/4r3/2P3QP/PP1B2PK/R2b4 w - - 0 28; Commentary: Black could have actuallyallowed White to take on e4 as after
FEN: 3r2k1/6p1/p4q1p/1pp5/4p3/2P3QP/PP1B2PK/3R4 w - - 1 30; Commentary: [%cal Rd8d3,Rf6d6] It transpires there is no easy way to get rid of the pin on the d-file.Black has ideas of Rd3-Qd6 and it is hard to make progress for White. Not aneasy continuation to evaluate, but objectively 27.Ng5? relinquished allWhite's advantage.

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: But this was abit surprising move to see from Botvinnik, who was a great specialist in theFrench defence, but also the Classical Sicilian and the Caro-Kann. Then again,back in the day it was easier to be versatile in the opening.
FEN: r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6; Commentary: I believe this is one of the rare instanceswhere Botvinnik played the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez.

If you want to check this particular line in greaterdetail, I would definitely recommend the course The Grand Ruy Lopez by NilsGrandelius on Chessable, as I know he covers the whole 9.c3 move order therein some detail.
FEN: r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/p1n1b3/1pbpP3/8/2P2N2/PPBN1nPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12; Commentary: This sacrifice, leading to the so-called Dilworthvariation in the Ruy Lopez, is extremely popular nowadays (as it is verydirect and suitable for analysis with Modern computers). For example, it wasrecently seen in the Candidates tournament in a game between Nakamura andCaruana.
FEN: r4rk1/2p3pp/p1n1bq2/1pbp4/8/2P2N2/PPBN1RPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 0 14; Commentary: But this is not the most precise move order, allowing White anadditional option we will see on the next move.
FEN: r4rk1/2p3pp/p1n1bq2/1pbp4/8/2P2N2/PPBN1RPP/R1B2QK1 b - - 1 14; Commentary: This is a difference. Now Whitemanages to include the queen very harmoniously in the game and doesn't have tolose time by going back to f2 and back with the king, which means that Whiteis comfortably better.
FEN: r4rk1/2p3pp/p1n2q2/1pbp4/6b1/2P2N2/PPBN1RPP/R1B2QK1 w - - 2 15; Commentary: Trying to increase the pressure on the f3 knight,but this is going into totally wrong direction.

FEN: 4rrk1/2p3pp/p4q2/1p1p4/6b1/2Pn1NQP/PP1N2P1/R1BB3K b - - 0 19; Commentary: Now White at least opens up the back rank with again of tempo, although the situation remains very unpleasant.

FEN: 4rrk1/6pp/p4q2/1ppp3b/8/2P2NQP/PPB1n1P1/R1B3NK w - - 2 23; Commentary: But this now comes at the least appropriate moment, justifying White'splay perfectly!

A fascinating, mind-boggling struggle kinda ahead of the time.It makes one brain explode to analyze this complicated game even with the helpof the engines - I can only imagine how the players (and contemporary analysts)felt when trying to figure things out by using the board and the pieces.
FEN: r4rk1/ppq1bppp/3pbn2/4pP2/4P3/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R3QRK1 b - - 0 13; Commentary: [%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5e6] A very strong continuationthat is very typical for this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6and e5). White grabs space on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 whereit can potentially be exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver,White does need to be careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5,which is not the case here because this advance comes with the tempo on thebishop on e6.
FEN: r4rk1/ppq1bppp/3p1n2/4pP2/2b1P3/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R3QRK1 w - - 1 14; Commentary: [%csl Rc4] Continuing with the idea of exchanging thebishops, but it is actually wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5square. It is much easier for Black's bishop to control the d5 square than forthe bishop on e2, so this exchange is very much in White's favour.
FEN: r4rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/4pPB1/2q1P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - - 1 15; Commentary: [%cal Rg5e7] A verystrong move! White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square andintends to plant their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can doagainst this plan, as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - thebishop on e6.
FEN: r3r1k1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/4pPB1/2q1P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - - 2 16; Commentary: It is probably better to put the rook on another file ason e8 it merely ends up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black'sposition is strategically suspect.
FEN: r3r1k1/pp3ppp/3p1b2/4pP2/2q1P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - - 0 17; Commentary: Now we can see Black has nopieces that can prevent the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and thatfactor alone is already sufficient for the game to be strategically lost.

FEN: r3r1k1/pp3ppp/3p1b2/3NpP2/4P3/8/PPq3PP/R3QRK1 w - - 0 18; Commentary: For better or for worse, Black should have probably captured the pawn onc2. At first glance it seems as if it loses an exchange - but at least itdisrupts the natural flow of the game - and forces White to give up thewonderful knight on d5 (that is easily worth at least a rook). Play mightcontinue

FEN: r5k1/pp3ppp/3p1b2/4pP2/4P3/8/qPR3PP/2R1Q1K1 b - - 1 22; Commentary: And even though Whitehas won an exchange, Black has two pawns for it and the conversion task is notat all trivial. I think this would have been a much better saving chance and Ifeel any modern player would go for something less clear and complicatedinstead of a position where play is extremely one-sided.
FEN: 2rbr2k/p4ppp/3p1P2/1pqNp3/4P3/1PP2R2/P5PP/R3Q2K b - - 0 22; Commentary: Now finally Smyslov decides on this pawn advance,opening up the kingside and creating a winning attack. It is possible to waitand play some further preparatory moves, but this is a good moment to strike!No matter how Black reacts, they are objectively completely lost.

FEN: 7k/p4prp/5Q2/1pqRp3/4P3/1PP5/P5PP/7K b - - 0 29; Commentary: [%cal Gd5d8] And here Rudakovsky finally decided to throw in the towel. Aconvincing, superb and crystal clear game by Smyslov that is a model exampleon winning the fight for the d5 square in these structures. I really likethese old games as their simplicity is sometimes extremely instructive. Mindyou, Rudakovsky wasn't some random slouch, but a very respectable master andthe game was played at the strongest competition of that time - the USSRChampionship - which just shows how much chess has evolved in the last 70years on all fronts - especially in regard to the opening knowledge and interms of defensive play.

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2; Commentary: But this is a bit surprising. Already back at thattime, Smyslov started playing the Closed Sicilian variation - an opening thatwould bring him a lot of success throughout his career. But, that day hedecided to go for the more principled battle in the Open Sicilian.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: The pure Scheveningen variation is considered tobe a bit risky nowadays due to the possibility of advancing the g-pawn on thenext move, but of course, back in 1945 the theory of this variation (and ofmany other openings) was only starting to develop.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 9; Commentary: The main move in thisposition, developing the knight, creating some pressure on the d4 knight andanticipating the advance of the f-pawn that would allow Black to execute thetimely e5 counterpush in the center. Black is trying to make an argument inthis variation that moving the a-pawn is not necessary and that they can startfighting for the center at once.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9; Commentary: White, in turn, embarks on the standard plan for this structure, involving theadvance of the kingside pawns.

Takingwith the bishop seems crazy as it gets rid of the bishop pair, but Black isclaiming that the knights are better in this position due to its closed nature.

A beautiful strategicmasterpiece that has always left a long-lasting impression on me - inparticular this counterintuitive move Qh4 transitioning to a won endgame. ---It is true that this game showcased Reshevsky's weaknesses - most notably inthe opening phase of the game. But don't forget he was one of the strongestplayers in the world for a loong time and that he would also have a rivarlywith the young Fischer in the late 1950s and early 1960s. --- Beating him inthis style was no easy feat and this game is a very good demonstration ofSmyslov's class at a time.

FEN: r2qkb1r/1ppbnppp/p1np4/4p3/3PP3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7; Commentary: This clever move, side-stepping all sorts of potential exchanges ofthe bishop and eyeing the f7 square, is the most common possibility here (although not the only one).

FEN: r2qr1k1/1ppb1pp1/p1np1bnp/3NP3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13; Commentary: For me, this is an oustanding move that showssuperb judgment. White deals with the threat to the e4 pawn and claims thatBlack has no good way of recapturing on e5 for positional reasons.
FEN: r2qr1k1/1ppb1pp1/p1np2np/3Nb3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14; Commentary: It is hard to say which recapture is better. Or more precisely - worse. Takingwith the bishop seems crazy as it gets rid of the bishop pair, but Black isclaiming that the knights are better in this position due to its closed nature.
FEN: r2qr1k1/1ppb1pp1/p1np2np/3NN3/4P3/1BP5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: Once again, White invites Black toplace a piece on e5 so that f4 can happen next.

Once again - the weak pawn on d6and the bishop pair are static, permanent advantages, so Smyslov is merelytrying to restrict Black as much as possible.

It is not entire clear how good this concept is even if it isexecuted, but now Smyslov finds an outstanding way to transition into awinning endgame.
FEN: rn5k/1p2qpp1/pB1pB2p/4p3/4P1Q1/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - - 0 25; Commentary: [%csl Re6] As they say, one advantage of havingthe bishop pair is the possibility of exchanging them at an opportune moment.This is a perfect example - White gives up the light-squared bishop in orderto ruin the structure and force the advantageous transformation of theposition.
FEN: rn5k/1p2q1p1/pB1pp2p/4p3/4P2Q/2P3P1/PP3P1P/3R2K1 b - - 1 26; Commentary: [%cal Rh4d8] A star move. When I first saw thispositional idea, I couldn't believe my eyes, as White is voluntarily invitingBlack to ruin the pawn structure, but in this position it is all about theactivity in the endgame.

Black refuses tocapture the rook but first opens up the bishop's diagonal and creates thethreat of capturing the rook and then retreating the bishop to e4 to cover theh7 pawn.

In this game, he decided to go for aquiet, unconventional approach, avoiding the theoretical battle and trying tomaintaing the tension from the early moments, hoping to outplay Smyslov in alater stage of the game.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: Even though Smyslov was playing theKing's Indian and GrÃ¼nfeld in his career, he was also regularly employing theNf6-e6 setups against 1.d4, so it is not that surprising to see him invite thetransposition to the Nimzo-Indian here.

FEN: rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7; Commentary: Now White finally takes a moment topush the d-pawn in the center. It is hard to count on any serious advantagewithout doing so.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8; Commentary: But this is a little bit strange decision,in my opinion. Black deliberately shuts the diagonal of the bishop on b2 andallows Black to transpose to some sort of Colle-System position.

Even though Black has equalized, the positionis definitely not "dead" and a lot of play remains - which is probably whatWhite players employing such an unpretentious scheme are hoping for.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1pn2/3p4/2PP4/1PNB1N2/PB3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 10; Commentary: [%csl Gc6][%cal Gc6b4,Gc6e7,Gc6a5] It feels a bit strange to place the knightto c6 where it is blocking the bishop on b7, but it is far more active therethan on d7 and can jump, say, to b4 - or even reroute itself via e7 at somepoint in the future. Also, if White ever plays a3, then Na5 comes intoconsideration.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/3p4/2PP4/1PNB1N2/PB3PPP/2RQR1K1 b - - 7 12; Commentary: [%cal Gf3e5] Now we haveactually transposed to one of the main lines of the Colle system that wastested in practice many many times.Both sides bring their forces into the game.In general, White wants to occupy the e5 square at some point.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1nPP4/1PNB1N2/PB3PPP/2RQR1K1 w - - 8 13; Commentary: [%csl Rd3][%cal Rb4d3,Rc8c4,Rd5c4,Gb7h1] One of the possible moves in this position,attacking the bishop on d3 and creating some play against hte c4 pawn.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3p4/1nPPn3/1PN2N2/PB3PPP/2RQRBK1 w - - 10 14; Commentary: I am not sure how good this jump of the knight to e4 is, though - eventhough it was also played recently at the very high level.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3p4/1nPPn3/PPN2N2/1B3PPP/2RQRBK1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: A nice intermediate move, kicking the knight fromb4 away.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3p4/1nPP4/PPR2N2/1B3PPP/3QRBK1 b - - 0 15; Commentary: [%cal Gc3h3] Now the rook is very active along the 3rd rank and has theoption of swinging to the kingside in due time. This position is actually verydangerous for Black and it can be concluded that Keres' opening choice hasworked very well up to this point.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/3pN3/2PP4/PPR5/1B3PPP/3QRBK1 b - - 2 16; Commentary: But almost immediatelyKeres goes for the wrong move, involving a faulty plan of attacking on thekingside with the pieces. It is hard to say why exactly this plan doesn't work- it simply isn't viable on the tactical, move per move basis.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3pR3/2PP4/PPR5/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: Consistently going for the attacking idea, butobjectively there was still time to change the mind.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1p/1p2pbp1/3p3R/2PP4/PP5R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 b - - 1 19; Commentary: The crux of Keres' idea is this bold andimaginative sacrifice of a full rook. Alas, he missed Smyslov'sultra-brilliant defensive reply.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1p/1p2pbp1/7R/2pP4/PP5R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: [%cal Gb7e4,Ge4h7] A cold showerand one of the most brilliant defensive moves ever played - especially if weconsider the competetive importance of this game. Black refuses to capture therook but first opens up the bishop's diagonal and creates the threat ofcapturing the rook and then retreating the bishop to e4 to cover the h7 pawn.Furthermore, the c-pawn now becomes an important asset in the position.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1R/1p2pbp1/8/2pP4/PP5R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 b - - 0 20; Commentary: This is the losing move, but it was hard tosuggest what White should do next.
FEN: 2rq1rk1/pb3p1R/1p2pbp1/8/3P4/PPp4R/1B3PPP/3Q1BK1 w - - 0 21; Commentary: [%cal Rc3b2] A cold shower! It turns out White has no attack going and now thepowerful c-pawn is shutting the bishop out of the game and threatening topromote very very fast.

FEN: 2rr2k1/pb3p1R/1p2pbpQ/8/3q4/PPp4R/1B3PPP/5BK1 w - - 2 23; Commentary: And now there is no mate and Black winsquickly due to the better pieces and the strong c-pawn.
FEN: 2r3k1/pb3pbR/1p2p1p1/8/3q1PQ1/PP5R/2p3PP/2BB2K1 w - - 1 29; Commentary: A remarkable defensiveeffort by Smyslov and one of those games that makes you feel sad for Keres asone gets the impression he was betrayed by his nerves at the moment when thetension was high. In any case, after this, in the following round Smyslov alsowent on to beat Reshevsky in a crucial encounter and ended up winning theCandidates Tournament 1953 with a 2 point difference, qualifying thus for thematch against the formidable Botvinnik.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2nBpbp/q1pp2p1/1p6/N1PpP1P1/5NP1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14; Commentary: [%cal Re7f8,Re7d6] From the modernviewpoint, this attack on the rook on f8 and the pawn on d6 can be regarded asbest.
FEN: r1b1r1k1/p2n1pbp/q1pB2p1/2P5/p2pP1P1/5NP1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16; Commentary: [%csl Ra4,Rc6,Rd4,Gd6] And Whiteshould have the objective advantage in this position due to the strong bishopon d6 and some cleaer targets in Black's position, although the position doesremain very complicated. Nevertheless, it seems that the practical results atthe grandmaster level favour White, which is probably one of the reasons whythese concrete line is not as popular nowadays.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/q1pp2p1/6B1/p1PNP1P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15; Commentary: Ok, the first move is obvious- take the hanging knight.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/q1Np2p1/6B1/p1P1P1P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15; Commentary: [%cal Ra6c6,Ge4e5] The point ofBotvinnik's play - luring the queen to c6 and preparing e5 next, opening thelight-squared bishop.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/3p2p1/4P1B1/p1q3P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17; Commentary: A tremendous reply (although there is not much choice). Smyslov simplycollects all the pawns that are offered and realizes he will receive a lot ofcompensation for the exchange.
FEN: B1b2rk1/p4pbp/3p2p1/4n1B1/p1q3P1/6P1/PP3P2/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 18; Commentary: [%csl Ge5,Rg4,Gg7][%cal Gg7b2]This position is dynamically balanced. Black's active pieces, the weakness ofthe g4 pawn and the dominant knight on e5 more than compensate for the missingexchange. And even though the game is objectively within the drawing marginsfrom the engine standpoint, it is very natural to expect it will not end in adraw in a game between two humans. I feel Black has better chances as hisposition is easier to play - and the subsequent course of the game confirmsthis.
FEN: B4rk1/pb3pbp/3p2p1/4n1B1/Q5P1/P5P1/1q3P2/2R2RK1 w - - 1 21; Commentary: [%cal Ra8h1,Ge5f3] A tremendous and creative move that tries to eliminate White'slight-squared bishop and exploit the weak light-squares around the enemy king,but it seemingly invites White to win material on the spot by playing Rb1.
FEN: B4rk1/pb3pbp/3p2p1/4n1B1/Q5P1/P5P1/1q3P2/1R3RK1 b - - 2 21; Commentary: Botvinnik once again goes for the materialistic option,underestimating the dynamic, sacrificial possibilities available in theposition - and it turns out to be the losing mistake.
FEN: b4rk1/p4pbp/3p2p1/6B1/Q5P1/P4nP1/1q3P2/1R3R1K w - - 0 23; Commentary: A tremendous move, ignoring the attack on the queen and simply sacrificing itfor three minor pieces.
FEN: b4rk1/p4p1p/3p2p1/8/Q5P1/P4nPK/1b3P2/5R2 w - - 0 26; Commentary: [%csl Ga8,Gb2,Gf3] Black now obtains three pieces for the queen in a position where theycoordinate perfectly and where White has a static pawn structure on thekingside that provides nice outposts (g5, f3) for these pieces. Thus, somewhatsurprisingly, White is simply dead lost here.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: In this match, Botvinnik was varying between 1.d4 and 1.c4, withthe former being seen in the majority of his White games.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: In turn, Smyslov played the Nimzo-Indian, Queen's Gambit Accepted, King'sIndian and GrÃ¼nfeld. In this game, though the King's Indian was seen for thevery first time.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: The fianchetto variation was not a surprising choicefor Botvinnik.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8; Commentary: This is arelatively old way of handling this variation that still has the right toexist to this day. Nowadays people have switched to the queenside pawnadvances - either with c5 or even the exotic a6-Rb8-b5.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9; Commentary: [%csl Gd5][%cal Gc6d5,Gd8a5] Black takes the d5 square under some control and opens upthe path for the queen. A very standard move in this type of position.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9; Commentary: [%csl Gd4][%cal Ge3d4] One of the many possible moves here, developing thebishop and adding some more protection to the d4 pawn.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp2p1/4p3/2PPP1n1/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 10; Commentary: [%csl Re3][%calRg4e3] The most common move in this position, disturbing the bishopimmediately, that is still being played to this day.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp2p1/4p1B1/2PPP1n1/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 11; Commentary: [%csl Rd4][%cal Rb6b2,Rb6d4] Black is trying to pressure the queenside and the centralpawn on d4 and is already planning the creative sacrifice that appears laterin the game.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp2p1/4p1B1/2PPP1n1/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11; Commentary: [%csl Rg4][%cal Rh3g4] But what now? It seems as if theknight on g4 has to retreat and that Black's entire opening strategy has kindof failed.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp2p1/6B1/2PpP1n1/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12; Commentary: A very creative and unexpected move, destroying thecenter after all and ignoring the attack to the knight on g4 for the moment.The drawback of this move is that it seemingly involves a piece sacrifice,although we will see it is only temporary. This move was repeated in a numberof high profile games even in 2021, so it is definitely playable, albeit a bitrisky.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp1n1pbp/1qpp2p1/6B1/N1PpP1n1/5NPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 12; Commentary: [%csl Rb6][%cal Ra4b6] This intermediate move, hittingthe queen and gaining time to capture on g4, seems a bit problematic, but theline doesn't yet end here.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/q1pp2p1/1p4B1/N1PpP1P1/5NP1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14; Commentary: [%csl Ra4][%cal Rb5a4] The pointof Black's play! With this move, the piece is regained as the knight doesn'thave anywhere to go. Alas, it transpires that the positional price for thistactical operation is a bit high as Black's pawn structure is in ruins andWhite should be able to fight for the advantage here.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/q1pp2p1/1p4B1/N1PNP1P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: Of course, itis easy to criticize the pioneers that trailblazed the path, but this isobjectively not the best move in the position. Botvinnik was surely temptedwith the subsequent sacrifice on c6, but must have underestimated/misevaluatedthe resulting position.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/q1Np2p1/6B1/p1P1P1P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15; Commentary: [%cal Ra6c6,Ge4e5] The pointof Botvinnik's play - luring the queen to c6 and preparing e5 next, openingthe light-squared bishop.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p2n1pbp/3p2p1/4P1B1/p1q3P1/6P1/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17; Commentary: A tremendous reply (althoughthere is not much choice). Smyslov simply collects all the pawns that areoffered and realizes he will receive a lot of compensation for the exchange.

FEN: B1b2rk1/p4pbp/3p2p1/4n1B1/p5P1/P5P1/1q3P2/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Maybe it was better not to take on b2, open theb-file and allow the a4 pawn to fall, but the evaluation of the position isnot significantly affected - yet.

FEN: 8/4Qpkp/2np2p1/P3b3/6P1/5bP1/2r2P2/1R3K2 w - - 7 34; Commentary: [%cal Rc6a5,Ge5d4] And nowwith Nxa5 and Bd4 being threatened, Botvinnik finally decided he has hadenough and decided to throw in the towel. A beautiful sacrificial dynamicconcept from a player many don't associate with such imbalanced, irrationalgames - but that definitely had the capability to play such games. --- Afterthis game, the score in the match was again level. Alas, Botvinnik then wongames 15 and 16, taking the two point lead. Smyslov won games 20 and 23, butfailed to win in the decisive, 24th game leaving the final score in the matchat 12-12. According to the match regulations, in the case of the tie,Botvinnik would retain the title, so Smyslov had to wait for another threeyears before having another shot at the title.

It is veryinstructive to observe how Smyslov quietly outplays his formidable opponent.
FEN: 2r3k1/6b1/2qnppp1/p2p3p/1p1P1P1P/3NPNP1/PP5K/3Q1R2 w - - 0 28; Commentary: One of the golden rules of the endgame play says - do not hurry. At thisparticular moment, maintaining the tension with some sort of semi-waiting movewas probably the strongest.
FEN: 5b2/5k2/4ppp1/p2p3p/1p1PnPPP/1P2PN1K/P7/3N4 w - - 1 36; Commentary: It was better to simply continue waiting and improving the position as it isnot entirely clear what White will do with the g-pawn.
FEN: 5b2/5k2/4ppp1/p2p3p/1p1PnPPP/1P2P2K/P7/3NN3 b - - 2 36; Commentary: Continuing to wait is probablythe best, but then Black can go for the central e5 pawn advance.

FEN: 8/4b3/4p1p1/p2p1p2/P2P1P1k/1Pp1PK2/2N5/8 b - - 0 45; Commentary: At this particular moment, it was absolutely necessary to advance thea-pawn. As mentioned earlier, it would have allowed White to have a nicedefensive resource at the exact moment as the a-pawn is now closer to queeningthan it is in the game, which means that some potential pawn endgames are notlost for White. It is really not easy to understand why this is so relevant,but it does work on the concrete basis.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p1p1/p2p1p2/P2P1P2/1PK1P3/2N1k3/8 w - - 1 49; Commentary: Here White has thesaving advance of the b-pawn:

FEN: 8/4b3/4p3/p2p1pp1/3P1P1k/1Pp1PK2/P7/4N3 w - - 0 46; Commentary: [%csl Gg5] Now this move is very powerful as Black removes oneobstacle on the kingside and White also needs to lose a tempo to get theknight back to c2 and initiate the whole idea with a4-b4 and so on - whichmeans that White is now objectively completely lost - in many pawn endgames,the weakness of the e3 pawn and the potential advance of the f-pawn will bedecisive. --- I think we could stop for the purposes of this exercise as thepath toward victory is still lengthy. Still, it is very instructive to observehow Smyslov goes about outmaneuvering Botivnnik and winning this position, soI would definitely urge the dear student to check the full game - or even tryto win this position against the computer.

Theidea is potentially to eliminate the knight on f6 that can sometimes jump toe4, but I am not sure if that is the most dangerous idea of all time.Furthermore, the bishop is exposed to Ne4 jumps on this particular square.

I guess the argument is that the knighton f6 is very valuable here and that Black's dark-squared bishop doesn't havethat much scope, but still - White does give up the bishop pair voluntarily.

But Black can play around this knight and in some verydistant future - White might regret that he weakened his kingside (as we willsee in the endgame in this game).

FEN: r4rk1/3q2bp/b2nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/4PNPB/PP2QN1K/2R1R3 w - - 2 23; Commentary: [%csl Ga5,Gb4][%calRa6f1] The passive bishop is now activated and space advantage has beensecured on the left hand side of the board. It is very instructive to observehow Smyslov quietly outplays his formidable opponent.
FEN: r1r3k1/3q2bp/b2nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/4PNPB/PP3N1K/2RQR3 w - - 4 24; Commentary: The nextstep is the occupation of the open file.
FEN: r1R3k1/3q2bp/b2nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/4PNPB/PP3N1K/3QR3 b - - 0 24; Commentary: This is a bit toocooperative. As usual, exchanging on our opponent's ground helpes them morethan it helps us to relievee the tension.
FEN: 2r3k1/3q2bp/b2nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/4PNP1/PP3N1K/3QRB2 b - - 1 25; Commentary: [%csl Gb5,Gc4,Ge4] Seeking further exchanges, butit transpires that this one is also to Black's benefit as now thelight-squares are weakened.
FEN: 2r3k1/6bp/2qnppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/4PNP1/PP3N1K/3Q1R2 w - - 1 27; Commentary: [%cal Gc6c2] Intending to playQc2 and go for a nice endgame.
FEN: 2r3k1/6bp/3nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/3NPNP1/PPq4K/3Q1R2 w - - 3 28; Commentary: This looks tempting, but the queen exchange actually relinquishes asignificant part of Black's advantage.
FEN: 6k1/6bp/3nppp1/p2p4/1p1P1P1P/3NPNP1/PPr2R1K/8 b - - 1 29; Commentary: [%csl Gf2][%cal Gd3f2] This is the problem for Black. Whitemanages to deal with the infiltration of the rook to c2 and now Black almosthas either exchange or retreat, meaning that a large part of the advantage isnow gone.
FEN: 6k1/6bp/4ppp1/p2p4/1pnP1P1P/4PNP1/PP5K/3N4 b - - 2 31; Commentary: [%csl Gb2][%cal Gd1e3,Gd1b2] Now allweaknesses are covered and without the heavy pieces on the board, it is hardto make progress for Black. Still, the game is far from over and now we entera completely new stage of the game.
FEN: 8/5kbp/4ppp1/p2p4/1pnP1P1P/1P2PNP1/P6K/3N4 b - - 0 32; Commentary: [%csl Rc3][%cal Rb3c4] Butthis is a mistake. It is natural to want to kick the knight from the c4 square,but in the process, White is weakening the c3 square.
FEN: 8/5kb1/3nppp1/p2p3p/1p1P1P1P/1P2PNP1/P5K1/3N4 w - - 0 34; Commentary: [%csl Gg4] Clamping down on thelight-squares! Black probably has to play this move sooner or later.
FEN: 8/5kb1/3nppp1/p2p3p/1p1P1P1P/1P2PNPK/P7/3N4 b - - 1 34; Commentary: White tries to play g4 to eliminate some pawns, in return.
FEN: 8/5kb1/4ppp1/p2p4/1p1PnPpP/1P2PN1K/P7/3N4 w - - 0 36; Commentary: But this exchange also turns out to be a mistake as it changes the characterof the structure on the kingside. Smyslov probably thought White's h4 pawnwould be a weakness in the long-run, but it transpires that this is notnecessarily true.
FEN: 8/5kb1/4p1p1/p2p1p2/1p1PnPKP/1P2PN2/P7/3N4 w - - 0 37; Commentary: I guess this was the point of Smyslov's idea. Now the d8-h4diagonal is open and Black can potentially try to attack the h4 pawn (which iswhat happens in the game). But it transpires that this is less strong thanwhat was considered in the previous note.
FEN: 8/6k1/4pbp1/p2p1p2/1p1PnP1P/1P1NP2K/P7/3N4 b - - 5 39; Commentary: [%csl Gd3] Now once again, White's pieces are doing a good job of defendingeverything and it is hard to make progress. That is why Smyslov decides tosharply alter the character of play and go for the transformation of theposition.
FEN: 8/6k1/4pbp1/p2p1p2/1p1P1P1P/1PnNP2K/P7/3N4 w - - 6 40; Commentary: Sharply changing the character of play at the verge of thefirst time control (which usually happened on move 40). Smyslov invites theexchange of the knight and transformation into a bishop vs. knight endgame andseemingly there is no way for Botvinnik to refuse it!
FEN: 8/6k1/4pbp1/p2p1p2/3P1P1P/1PpNP2K/P7/8 w - - 0 41; Commentary: [%csl Rc3] So, let us stop for themoment and ask ourselves - why exactly should Black pretend to be better inthis endgame? Well, the pawn on c3 is a temporary distraction for our opponentand needs to be dealt with. The only way in which White can do so is goingwith the king all the way to d3 and then capturing it. This, in turn shouldallow Black to capture the h4 pawn (which is something h can do anyway,actually) and run with king to f2, threatening to capture on e3. Furthermore,Black can also push g5 and then f4 at the appropriate moment. Thus, White hasto defend accurately as Black has a clear plan of going forward.
FEN: 8/6k1/4pbp1/p2p1p2/3P1P1P/1Pp1P2K/P7/4N3 b - - 1 41; Commentary: Missing the immediate opportunity to resolve all problems!
FEN: 8/8/4pbpk/p2p1p2/3P1P1P/1Pp1P2K/P1N5/8 b - - 3 42; Commentary: [%cslGc2,Rc3,Gd3] Maneuvering the knight to c2 is very sensible, though, as now thepawn is blockaded and the d3 square vacated for the king.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p1pk/p2p1p2/3P1P1P/1Pp1P2K/P1N5/8 w - - 4 43; Commentary: Now Black doesprevent the b-pawn from advancing before assaulting the h4 pawn.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p1pk/p2p1p2/3P1P1P/1Pp1P1K1/P1N5/8 b - - 5 43; Commentary: Not yet losing, but it does demonstrate Botvinnik was not aware of the keyidea in this position (which will end up costing him later). He could haveadvanced the a-pawn here at once.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p1p1/p2p1p1k/3P1P1P/1Pp1P1K1/P1N5/8 w - - 6 44; Commentary: Black, of course, collects the h-pawn and tries to infiltrate with theking.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p1p1/p2p1p2/3P1P1k/1Pp1PK2/P7/4N3 b - - 1 45; Commentary: But this is now the losing moment. Botvinnik decides to stay passive and keepwaiting, but it transpires that this is the wrong strategy as Black is nowable to outmaneuver him, put him into zugzwang and infiltrate with his kinginto the position.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p3/p2p1pp1/3P1P1k/1Pp1PK2/P7/4N3 w - - 0 46; Commentary: Now this move is very powerful as Black removes oneobstacle on the kingside and White also needs to lose a tempo to get theknight back to c2 and initiate the whole idea with a4-b4 and so on - whichmeans that White is now objectively completely lost. Still, it is veryinstructive to observe how Smyslov goes about outmaneuvering Botivnnik andwinning this position.
FEN: 8/8/3bp3/p2p1pk1/3P4/1Pp1PK2/P7/4N3 b - - 3 48; Commentary: Trying to staypassive, but now Smyslov embarks on an instructive outflanking maneuver.
FEN: 8/8/4p3/p2p1p2/3P3b/1Pp1P3/P1N1K3/6k1 b - - 15 54; Commentary: White is trying to stop the king frominfiltrating at all costs.
FEN: 8/8/4pb2/p2p1p2/3P4/PPp1P1k1/2N1K3/8 b - - 0 59; Commentary: Finally trying to create some counterplay, but it is too late.
FEN: 8/4b3/4p3/3p1p2/pP1P4/P1p1P1k1/2N1K3/8 w - - 0 61; Commentary: The bishop will easily deal with the b-pawn and Black also has the f4pawn push at the right moment, if required.
FEN: 8/8/4pb2/3p1p2/pP1P4/P1p1P1k1/2N1K3/8 w - - 4 63; Commentary: Black isin some sort of zugzwang. They wouldn't really love to move the knight or theking - but there is not much choice.
FEN: 8/8/4pb2/3p1p2/pP1P4/P1pKP1k1/2N5/8 b - - 5 63; Commentary: Finally giving up and lettingthe king further.
FEN: 8/8/4p3/3p1pb1/pP1P4/P1pKP3/2N2k2/8 w - - 10 66; Commentary: The final zugzwang.
FEN: 8/8/4p3/1P1p1pb1/p2P4/P1pKP3/2N2k2/8 b - - 0 66; Commentary: What else?
FEN: 8/8/4p3/bP1p1p2/pN1P4/P1pKP3/8/4k3 w - - 7 70; Commentary: And here Botvinnik finally resigned as the king will penetrate either to e2 orto the queenside and White will end up in a similar zugzwang as in thevariation analyzed on move 66. A tremendous game and absolutely mesmerizingendgame play by Smyslov - at such an important and crucial moment of the match.--- After this game, Smyslov also won the 20th game and clinched the matchafter 22 games with the score 12.5-9.5, becoming, thus, the 7th World Champion.Alas, his reign would last only for one year as he would lose the title thevery next year in the 1958 rematch, although his career would continue for aloong loong time after that.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2PNpP2/1Q2P1P1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 b - f3 0 22; Commentary: [%csl Gf4][%cal Rf4g5,Rf4e5] A very powerful move, opening up the kingside to White'sadvantage and at the same time preventing Balck from ever playing f4! White'spieces are all perfectly placed so it is very natural that a pawn move is thebest.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PpP1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 w - - 0 23; Commentary: [%csl Re3,Ge4,Gg4] Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3square and provided the e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in thisposition where both sides have some weak squares, Black's weaknesses are morepronounced simply because White has better placed pieces.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2P5/1Q2PNP1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 b - - 0 23; Commentary: [%csl Rg5][%cal Rf3g5,Rb2h8] Taking with the knight, opening up the bishop andthreatening the g5 pawn was actually better. After, say
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bb1/1p1p1nnp/1P1P1pp1/2PN4/1Q2P1P1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 b - - 1 24; Commentary: [%cal Rd4f5,Rg2e4] The knight can simply go back,attack the f5 pawn at the moment when the bishop is keeping the e4 squareunder control.
FEN: 4rr1k/2pqnbbp/1pNp4/1P1n1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PRP1/1B4BP/5RK1 b - - 1 26; Commentary: [%csl Rf5][%cal Rf1f5,Rd4f5] White could have simply ignored the knight on d5and continued with the siege of the f5 pawn. The knight would still be hangingin that case and Black would have been left with less counterplay with bestplay, although the position still remains complicated, of course. --- Othermoves that decline the sacrifice are also possible, but this one seems to bethe most natural! White should be completely winning!
FEN: 4r1k1/2pqn1Bp/1pNp4/1P1b1Rp1/8/1Q2P1P1/6BP/R5K1 b - - 0 29; Commentary: [%csl Rg5][%cal Rf5g5,Rg2d5,Rb3d5] This is the point of White'scombination! Smyslov sacrifices a full queen, but is ready to capture on g5next and execute a devastating winning attack.
FEN: 4r1k1/2pqn1Bp/1pNp4/1P3Rp1/8/1b2P1P1/6BP/R5K1 w - - 0 30; Commentary: The only move!
FEN: 4r1k1/2pqn1Bp/1pNp4/1P4R1/8/1b2P1P1/6BP/R5K1 b - - 0 30; Commentary: White has a bishopand the rook for the queen. But more importantly - the king on g8 iscompletely exposed and various threats are in the air. White should beobjectively winning - although a lot of play remains in the position, ofcourse.
FEN: 4r1k1/2p4p/1pNpb1nB/1P3R2/7P/6P1/5RBK/4q3 w - - 1 37; Commentary: [%cal Re6f5] It was not very easy to find the onlydefence here though. Black had to attack the rook on f5 and force it to f6before moving the king to the corner. This was the only way to deal againstboth h5 and Bd2 threats.
FEN: 4r1k1/2p4p/1pNpbRnB/1P6/7P/6P1/5RBK/4q3 b - - 2 37; Commentary: [%calGh4h5] Now the long diagonal is blocked so Black can sidestep the h5 threat.
FEN: 4r2k/2p4p/1pNpbRnB/1P6/7P/6P1/5RBK/4q3 w - - 3 38; Commentary: [%cal Ge6g8] This move prepares the defensive Bg8 resource which meansthat h5 loses its power.
FEN: 4r2k/2p4p/1pNpbRnB/1P5P/8/6P1/5RBK/4q3 b - - 0 38; Commentary: White should play something else andmaintain the balance, but in order to illustrate the point, let's see whathappens after the advance of the h-pawn:
FEN: 5Rbk/2p4p/1pNp3B/1P2n2P/8/6P1/6BK/4q3 w - - 1 41; Commentary: And it is suddenly Black who wins, not White.
FEN: 4r1k1/2p4p/1pNp2n1/1b3R2/7P/6P1/3B1RBK/4q3 b - - 1 37; Commentary: [%csl Rb5][%cal Rd2e1,Gd2c3] Now it is all over as Black can't defend the b5bishop AND cover the c3 square. This is not the only winning move, but sooneror later White has to find this idea.
FEN: 4r1k1/2p4p/1pNp2n1/1b3R2/7P/6P1/3B1RBK/1q6 w - - 2 38; Commentary: Probably it was better to give upthe queen, but Black's position remains lost all the same. Now, however, Whitedelivers a forced checkmate.
FEN: 4r1k1/2p4p/1pNp2n1/1b1B1R2/7P/6P1/3B1R1K/1q6 b - - 3 38; Commentary: Anotherconsequence of the bishop moving from the a2-g8 diagonal.
FEN: 4r2k/2p4p/1p6/1b1BR3/7P/2B3P1/5R1K/1q6 b - - 0 41; Commentary: [%csl Rh8] And mate soon follows, so Black resigned. Afascinating encounter, featuring both typical slow Smyslov play in the openingstage of the game and a dashing, violent and not fully correct Tal-liketactical culmination in the end of the game.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1; Commentary: Not a surprising opening move by Smyslov. Especially in hislater years, he switched from 1.e4 to slower, closed systems with increasingfrequency.
FEN: r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/1RBQK1NR b Kkq - 3 5; Commentary: Preparing the push ofthe b-pawn is a standard plan in a number of positions where the pawn on c4 ismeeting the pawn on e5.
FEN: r1bqk1nr/1pp2pbp/p1np2p1/4p3/1PP5/2N3P1/P2PPPBP/1RBQK1NR w Kkq - 0 7; Commentary: I am not sure if this move is requiredas it helps White to open up things on the queenside with b5, although it wasplayed by some strong players so what do I even know.
FEN: r1bqk1nr/1pp3bp/p1np2p1/4pp2/1PP5/2N1P1P1/P2P1PBP/1RBQK1NR w Kkq - 0 8; Commentary: I am also nottoo sure about this aggressive setup with f5 in these positions - especiallywith White having played e3 instead of d3, but once again, since I don't playthese positions with either colour my insight should be taken with a hugegrain of salt. --- Nevertheless, this is a very fresh position with only ahandful of games in the database.
FEN: r2q1rk1/1ppb2bp/p1np1np1/4pp2/PPP5/2NPP1P1/4NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 0 11; Commentary: [%cal Gb4b5] White is very clearly preparing to go b5.
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/1ppb2bp/p1np1np1/4pp2/PPP5/2NPP1P1/4NPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 1 12; Commentary: But this movedoesn't make sense to me at all. If you played a6 earlier, weren't you hopingto open up the a-file for the rook once b5 happens? Why defend the pawnmodestly with the rook then and deviate from that plan?
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/1ppbn1bp/3p1np1/1P2pp2/2P5/B1NPP1P1/4NPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 2 14; Commentary: [%cal Ra3f8,Gb5b6]An active place for the bishop in these positions, as it is fairly active onthis diagonal and eyeing the c5 square, preparing for the potential c5 push.There is also the idea of playing b6 next.
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/1pp1n1bp/3pbnp1/1P2pp2/2P5/BQNPP1P1/4NPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 4 15; Commentary: I am not 100% sureabout this move as now c5 is not possible, although the computer doesn'tcomplain.
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/2p1n1bp/1p1pbnp1/1P2pp2/2P5/BQNPP1P1/4NPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 16; Commentary: But this is apparently wrong. Black decides toprevent c5 once at for all, but he is playing on the side of the board wheretheir opponent is attacking.
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/2p1n1bp/1p1pbnp1/1P2pp2/2PP4/BQN1P1P1/4NPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 0 16; Commentary: Quite a good move, trying to react in the center. White also tries to exploitthe newly weakened c6 square? How exactly. Watch and see!
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/2p1n1bp/1p1pbnp1/1P3p2/2PPp3/BQN1P1P1/4NPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 17; Commentary: Black can'tafford the center to open given that all White pieces are very actively placed.
FEN: 1r1q1rk1/2p1n1bp/1p1pbnp1/1P1P1p2/2P1p3/BQN1P1P1/4NPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: [%csl Gc6,Gd4,Re6][%cal Rd5e6,Ge2d4,Gd4c6,Ga3b2] A very nicepositional move, opening up the d4 square for the knight from where it can goto e6 and c6. It is true that this move weakens the e5 and c5 squares, but wehave to lose some to gain some. Also, with this move we pretty much give up onthe c5 idea, but we are ready to reroute our bishop to b2.
FEN: 1r3rk1/2pqnbbp/1p1p1np1/1P1P1p2/2PNp3/1QN1P1P1/1B3PBP/1R3RK1 b - - 4 19; Commentary: [%cal Rb2g7] The bishop retreats to the longdiagonal.

FEN: 1r3rk1/2pqnbbp/1p1p1n2/1P1P1pp1/2PNp3/1Q2P1P1/1B2NPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 20; Commentary: White slowly improves the pieces. Note howSmyslov doesn't hurry to jump with the d4 knight to either e6 or c6.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pqnbbp/1p1p1n2/1P1P1pp1/2PNp3/1Q2P1P1/1B2NPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 2 21; Commentary: Somewhat aimless move. It turns out the kingmight be in danger on this square in the future.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2PNpP2/1Q2P1P1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 b - f3 0 22; Commentary: A verypowerful move, opening up the kingside to White's advantage and at the sametime preventing Balck from ever playing f4! White's pieces are all perfectlyplaced so it is very natural that a pawn move is the best.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PpP1/1B2N1BP/R4RK1 w - - 0 23; Commentary: [%csl Re3,Ge4,Gg4] Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3 square and providedthe e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in this position where bothsides have some weak squares, Black's weaknesses are more pronounced simplybecause White has better placed pieces.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pq1bbp/1p1p1nn1/1P1P1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PRP1/1B2N1BP/R5K1 b - - 0 23; Commentary: This is, actually, notthe most precise continuation.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pqnbbp/1p1p1n2/1P1P1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PRP1/1B2N1BP/R5K1 w - - 1 24; Commentary: But this passive defence of thef5 pawn is, well, simply too passive.
FEN: 1r3r1k/2pqnbbp/1pNp1n2/1P1P1pp1/2P5/1Q2PRP1/1B2N1BP/R5K1 b - - 2 24; Commentary: [%csl Gc6][%cal Ge2d4] Finally jumping toa weak square and hoping to eliminate the important defender of the f5 pawn.The other knight can always come to d4 and reinfroce the attack.

FEN: 4rr1k/2pqnbbp/1pNp4/1P1n1pp1/2PN4/1Q2PRP1/1B4BP/R5K1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: This is absolute desperation, but probably the best practical attemptto confuse matters.
FEN: 4rr1k/2pqnbbp/1pNp4/1P1P1pp1/3N4/1Q2PRP1/1B4BP/R5K1 b - - 0 26; Commentary: But this recapture is probably a bitunecessary as it provides Black with reasonable counterplay all of a sudden.
FEN: 4rr1k/2pqn1bp/1pNp4/1P1b1Np1/8/1Q2PRP1/1B4BP/R5K1 b - - 0 27; Commentary: A very creative, Tal-like move, involving the sacrifice of the full queen,that is objectively fully correct - but probably not the most practical. Theidea is to uncover the attack on the g7 bishop and create play against theweakened king.
FEN: 4r2k/2pqn1bp/1pNp4/1P1b1rp1/8/1Q2PRP1/1B4BP/R5K1 w - - 0 28; Commentary: The onlysensible move in this crazy position.

White doesn'thave an attack here and Black should be objectively winning (although theposition does remain to be difficult to play for both sides).

FEN: r7/pp2kn2/4p3/3r4/8/P4P2/1Q3P1P/R5K1 b - - 0 32; Commentary: Black hasa rook and the knight for the queen and a pawn, which is insufficient materialcompensation. Furthermore, the king is weak and the queenside pawns are veryexposed, so White doesn't have any particular trouble in converting thisposition into a full point!

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: Not the most ambitioustest of Black's opening scheme.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10; Commentary: So, by transposition we have reached a standard position where Whiteis the one with the isolated pawn on d4. Still, White has numerous attackingideas here so the weakness of the isolated pawn shouldn't be overemphasized.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pb2/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11; Commentary: [%cal Rf6d4] Placing the bishop on a square where it is exerting pressureon the d4 pawn and controlling the e5 square is quite logical - although notthe only way of handling the position.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pb2/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 11; Commentary: [%cal Rc2h7] With this move,White tries to provoke a concession on the kingside as now the knight isunable to go to f6 to defend the h7 pawn. Once again, there are other naturalmoves in the position, but this idea seems quite reasonable.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2n1pb1p/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 12; Commentary: Trying to gowithout the weakening of the dark-squares, but this move allows White to tryto go for the more standard battery with the queen in front of the bishop (aswe will see happen in the game).
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2n1pb1p/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 1 12; Commentary: Alsobringing the rook into play and indirectly defending the d4 pawn.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/1qn1pb1p/3n4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 w - - 2 13; Commentary: [%csl Gc8][%cal Rb6d4,Rc6d4,Rf6d4] But this move is a bit too optimistic. Thequeen tries to pressure the d4 pawn, but it is not particularly well-placed onb6 and it is blocking the standard b6-Bb7 development.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/1qn1pb1p/3n4/2BP4/P1N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 3 13; Commentary: But this is not the most precise move. Smyslov tries topressure the d5 point and potentially exchange there and eliminate theweakness, but it transpires Black has ways of dealing with that idea.

FEN: r2r2k1/pp1b1pp1/1qn1pb1p/3n4/2BPQ3/P4N2/1P2NPPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 7 15; Commentary: Smyslov intends to put the bishop on d3 and create some threats to the king,although objectively speaking this shouldn't work - especially since Whitelost some time moving the queen and the bishop back and forth.

Still, sooner or later this knight will go to g6, so there is notthat much harm in doing it at this point.

A wonderful creative achievement, sort of a swanson of Smyslov's career- even if the opening was very suspect from the modern day standards. Afterthis game, Smyslov took 1-point lead and then went on to win game 7, as wellas the match, qualifying for the final Candidates match against Garry Kasparov.--- A virtually unparalleled achievement at a such stage in the history ofchess - perhaps only Viktor Korchnoi achieved the same success in the WorldChampionship Cycle at an advanced age (although not even Korchnoi played theCandidates Final match above the age of 60).

White wanted toopen up the a3-f8 diagonal in order to pressure the queen on e7. Alas, ittranspires this is NOT that dangerous as it can be met with the simpleinteference with the c-pawn, as we will soon see.

White violates one of the basic principles of not moving thesame piece twice in the opening.  Although the position is somewhat slow andclosed enough, I think that he loses some of his flexibility; the knight mighttake the alternative Nc3-Ne3 route in the future if neccessary.

Compared to the previoustwo games, he went all in in this one, but the tactical finish was allowedonly by his opponent's mistakes; they didn't result from his strategicalsuperiority.

Had such a conception been played in the 21st century,everyone would assume it was computer preparation. However, it was 1886... Steinitz embarks on a modern knight sacrifice, for which he gains long termcompensation

FEN: rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2; Commentary: In general, this move doesn't fit well with 1.d4. The reasonis that it fails to place maximum pressure on the important d5-square, and italso doesn't do anything for the eventual freedom of white's Rooks. Far morecommon is 2.c4 (gaining central and queenside space) when 3.Nc3 will join withthe c4-pawn to pressure d5, while also setting up situations where &amp;ndash;if Black plays ...d7-d5 at some point &amp;ndash; White will chop on d5 (cxd5)and open up the c-file for his Rooks. Nevertheless, 2.Nc3 has its supporters&amp;ndash; the early Knight move forces black's hand (...d7-d5), otherwiseWhite will play e2-e4 and grab the center. This often leads to sharp, unusualplay, and can easily take Black out of all his opening preparation.

FEN: rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/3p4/3P4/2NbP3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: Thisremoves black's Bishop pair and, by simplifying, takes away any dynamism thatmight have remained in the black position. My old friend grandmaster NigelDavies (we shared some interesting adventures in the jungles of Brazil&amp;ndash; these included an attack on the Mayor's house, me pretending to be acop and demanding entrance [by kicking in a door] to a well known grandmaster'shotel room, an insane Hitler mime that kept sneaking up on the players andfreaking everyone out, and a stampede of coatimundis at Iguazu Falls), in hisbook, THE VERESOV (2003), had this to say: \"Black's best plan is to retreat hisBishop from f5 to e6, play ...f6-f5, and then bring his Knight from b8-e4 via d7and f6.\"
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/3p4/3P4/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: The fact is this position is a little better for White, withthe caveat that Black's ideal result is a draw, while White will be pushing formore throughout the game. In other words, it's an ideal grandmaster opening thatoffers White chances to win, and few chances to lose. Why is this the case? Thepawn structure answers that question: white's structure is devoid of weaknessesand offers two key pawn breaks &amp;ndash; c2-c4 or e3-e4. Black's structure isless flexible and lacks the same type of fluid breaks since ...c6-c5 would leaved5 weak, and ...f6-f5-f4 is very difficult to achieve. Other than these basicpositional ideas, if Black castles short, White can also go for the kingsidenuke option via g2-g4, h2-h4, etc. Thus, for the most part black's position ispassive, and he'll usually just hold tight and hope to earn that half a point.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/3p4/3PP3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: This move, which scores very well for White, seeks tocreate a favorable pawn structure in one of two ways: 1) Black will leave thepawn on e4 and let White take on d5. The resulting isolated pawn on d5 willprove rather weak; 2) Black will capture on e4, which will result in positionswhere White is half a pawn ahead (black's crippled kingside majority won't beable to create a passed pawn in most endgames). In this 2nd scenario, Blackisn't badly placed, but he will face a long, thankless defensive task. And, as Isaid earlier, if black's successful, he'll get no more than a draw.
FEN: r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p2p2/8/3PNb2/8/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w kq - 3 13; Commentary: The pawn structure after 12&hellip;Nd7 isidentical to positions Ulf Andersson got in the 70s. In fact, the Black side ofthis structure was his bread and butter and he rarely lost against world-classopposition! If you or anyone else wants to play this line vs. the Verasov, youneed to make a detailed study of that structure and then you can enter theselines with confidence. Actually, this is how you should study all openings:master the pawn structures, understand the pros and cons of those structures,and only then memorize some moves (they will make a lot more sense after you\"grok\" the structures).
FEN: r3k2r/ppbn1ppp/2p2p2/3P4/4N3/8/PPP1NPPP/1K1R3R b kq - 0 14; Commentary: Actually, this pawn is keepingan eye on two important squares (c5 and e5) so I'm not sure White should rush tomake this swap. In fact, Black would eventually try and trade off that pawnhimself via ...c6-c5. On the other hand, Mr. Andersson has shown us that thisposition (with or without d4-d5) isn't a big deal for White, as long as Blackunderstands the nuances of this structure.
FEN: 3k4/ppb2ppp/8/4np2/4N3/7P/PPP1NPP1/1K6 w - - 0 20; Commentary: One should be aware of thedifference in mentality here: Black played into this thinking that he had a verygood chance to draw a strong player, while White entered it because he knew hehad a very good chance at wearing Black down without suffering any riskwhatsoever. And ... both players are right!
FEN: 8/1p3ppp/8/pNk2p2/2P1nP2/1P5P/P1K2bP1/2N5 b - - 3 29; Commentary: White continues to play strong, calm moves. He knows Black will need to makesome mistakes to lose the game, so he doesn't rush &ndash; instead he quietlybuilds his position, seeks ideal positions for his Knights, and hopes Blackcracks due to the strain of having to constantly defend. As you can see, theexperienced (and strong) player knows very well that one-move threats literallyforce the opponent to be on his guard, and that the resulting heightened senseof danger usually results in good moves. Thus, instead of forcing the issue,White patiently keeps improving his position and follows this classic old rule:\"When it doubt, let the opponent get an idea, it&rsquo;s bound to be wrong.\"

In fact, for all intents and purposes, one can say thatthis is the decisive mistake because, even though I think the game can still besaved, the defense is so difficult that many players (even masters) would godown in flames.

FEN: 3rk2r/2p2ppp/Qbp1bq1n/1p6/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w k - 1 14; Commentary: Black has given up a pawn,but the white queen is out of play and Black has some kingside threats.Nevertheless, the extra pawn is a resource White can trade for position at theright moment.
FEN: 2brk2r/2p2ppp/Qbp2q1n/1p6/4P3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w k - 3 15; Commentary: Black must drive the queen before capturing on e3,since otherwise 15.Qxc6+ would follow.
FEN: 2brk2r/2p2ppp/2p4n/1p2q3/4P3/Q1NBP3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w k - 1 17; Commentary: Muchbetter was 16...Qg5, which would attack e3 and thus give Black time to play ...Ng4. Now that knight will be locked out.
FEN: 2brk2r/2p2ppp/2p4n/1p2q3/4P3/Q1N1P3/PPP1B1PP/R4RK1 b k - 2 17; Commentary: White'sadvantage is not so much due to the extra pawn - which is doubled and isolated -but the fact that the black king is locked in the center and the black knight isstuck on the side. If Black plays ...Ng4 anyway, White will capture it andBlack's remaining bishop will not be able to contest the dark squares.
FEN: 2b2rk1/2p2ppp/2pR3n/1p2q3/4P3/Q1N1P3/PPP1B1PP/5RK1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: White improves Black's pawn structure, but onlysuperficially. As a result of this exchange Black's d-pawn becomes a realweakness.
FEN: 2b2rk1/5ppp/3p3n/1pp1q3/4P3/Q1N1P3/PPP1B1PP/3R2K1 w - - 0 21; Commentary: Black tries to create counterplay. A betterchance, however, was the calm 20...Rd8.
FEN: 5rk1/5ppp/3p3n/1Np5/Pq2P1b1/3QP3/2P1B1PP/3R2K1 w - - 1 24; Commentary: Black has regained one pawn, but the white queen is back in the gameand the knight will be very strong on d6.
FEN: 5rk1/4qppp/3Nb2n/2p1P3/4Q3/4PB1P/2P3P1/1R4K1 b - - 4 29; Commentary: Still Black remains with the constant problem -the Nh6 - while White gains more and more space.
FEN: 2Q4k/4q1pp/3Nb2n/4Pp2/8/4PB1P/2P3P1/1R4K1 b - - 0 32; Commentary: The cleanest way to finish off the game.

FEN: r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5; Commentary: 5.Nb3 has probably become themain move in recent years, although Kasparov never played that way and the movewas pretty rare back then.
FEN: r1b2rk1/ppppnppp/1bn2q2/8/2BNP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 5 9; Commentary: 8...b6 isa solid defense, often played now.
FEN: r1b2rk1/ppppnppp/1bn2q2/8/2B1P3/2P1B3/PPN2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 6 9; Commentary: Kasparov rearranges his pieces,with the knight coming to e3, combined with f2-f4.
FEN: r1b2rk1/1pp1np1p/1pnp1q2/6p1/2B1PP2/2P5/PPN3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 12; Commentary: A creative positional move, trying to conquer the dark squares. Kasparovmakes it look bad, but it was not so clear.
FEN: r4rk1/1ppbnp1p/1p1p1q2/4nP2/2P1P1p1/8/PPN1B1PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 15; Commentary: Black should have left the pawn on g5. Now White gets chances to use thef4-square or invade with the queen on that diagonal.
FEN: r4r1k/1pp1np2/1pbp1q2/4nP1p/2P1PQp1/2N1N3/PP2B1PP/R4RK1 b - - 5 18; Commentary: Black has this dark square blockade, but otherwise his positionis very passive. If he did nothing White could continue with b4, a4, b5, andthen Nd5, or look for other ways to break through. Instead Short tries toprepare a rearrangement with ...Qe5 and ...Nf6, but allows Kasparov to make astrong piece sacrifice.
FEN: r4r1k/1ppnnp2/1pbp1q2/5P1p/2P1PQB1/2N1N3/PP4PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: This was well calculated.
FEN: r4r1k/1ppnnp2/1pbp4/5P2/2P1PQNq/2N2R2/PP4PP/R5K1 b - - 2 21; Commentary: This looks strong, but Kasparov had to anticipateShort's next move.
FEN: r4r1k/1ppn1p2/1pbp2n1/5P2/2P1PQNq/2N2R2/PP4PP/R5K1 w - - 3 22; Commentary: Clearly the only hope, otherwise Rh3 is coming.
FEN: r4r1k/1ppn1p2/1pbp2n1/5P2/2P1P1Nq/2N1QR2/PP4PP/R5K1 b - - 4 22; Commentary: Even better than taking the knight.
FEN: r4rk1/1ppn1p2/1pbp2nQ/5P2/2P1P1q1/2N4R/PP4PP/R5K1 b - - 3 24; Commentary: Even better was24.Rg3, which forces Black to give up the queen without exposing the white kingso much, while also opening the h-file.
FEN: r4rk1/1ppn1p2/1pbp2nQ/5P2/2P1P3/2N4q/PP4PP/R5K1 w - - 0 25; Commentary: 24...Nf6 loses to 25.fxg6 fxg6 27.Rg3.
FEN: r4rk1/1pp2p2/1pbp1Q2/4n3/2P1P3/2N4P/PP5P/R5K1 b - - 0 27; Commentary: Now Black has a rook andbishop against a queen and a pawn. There are some chances because of the strongNe5 and the open white king, but it is much worse for Black.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1ppqp1p/b1p3p1/3nP3/2P5/1P6/P3QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: Bacrot plays the same move as Karpov used in Tilburg, but ofcourse by this point there was more known and established theory, so Bacrot wasgoing into it with his eyes open. 9...g5 is another critical move.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp1p1p/b1p3p1/3nP3/1qP2P2/1P6/P3Q1PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 11; Commentary: Indeed, Karpov himself had introduced this against Gelfand shortly after theTilburg game.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp1p1p/bqp3p1/3nP3/2P1QP2/1P6/P2B2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 4 12; Commentary: Many games had gone 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.Bxc3Bb4, with Black equalizing pretty easily, or some other similar exchange. Thismove was not quite new, but Kasparov had prepared it deeply.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp3p/bqp3p1/3nPp2/2P2P2/1P3Q2/P2B2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 13; Commentary: Kasparov judged that inducing ...f5 was important.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp3p/b1p3p1/3nPp2/2Pq1P2/1P3Q2/P2B2PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 14; Commentary: A tempting move,although Bacrot later improved his own play with 13...Nb4, which is, I believe,where the theory stands today.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp3p/b1p3p1/4Pp2/2Pq1P2/1PB2Q2/P5PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 15; Commentary: This is strongerthan 15.Qxc3, since now Black is forced to exchange the bishops (15...Qb6 16.e6is very bad).
FEN: 2kr3r/p1pp3p/b1p3p1/2P1Pp2/3q1P2/1PR2Q2/P5PP/4KB1R b K - 0 18; Commentary: Now Black has afixed weakness on the d-file - advancing the d-pawn will not always be easy dueto the opening of the c-file.
FEN: 2kr3r/pbpp3p/2p3p1/2P1Pp2/3q1P2/1PR2Q2/P5PP/4KB1R w K - 1 19; Commentary: It was natural to exchange the bishops- indeed, Black does not want to be left with such a useless creature as that onb7. But Bacrot worried that his weakened king would force him to make additionalconcessions.
FEN: 2kr3r/pbpp3p/2p3p1/2P1Pp2/3q1P2/1PR1Q3/P5PP/4KB1R b K - 2 19; Commentary: Now, with c4-c5 achieved (so there will be no ...c5 forBlack), and the bishop passive on b7, Kasparov is happy to go into the ending.
FEN: 2kr3r/pbp4p/2pp2p1/2P1Pp2/5P2/1P2R3/P5PP/4KB1R w K - 0 21; Commentary: The only way to look for active play.
FEN: 3r3r/pbpk3p/2pp2p1/2P1Pp2/2B2P1P/1P2R3/P5P1/4K2R b K - 0 22; Commentary: White prepares to atttack the pawn chain.
FEN: 3r3r/pbpk3p/2p3p1/2PpPp2/2B2P1P/1P2R3/P5P1/4K2R w K - 0 23; Commentary: Black can hardly dowithout closing the center. For example, if 22...dxe5 23.Rxe5 Rhe8 White canhappily trade the rooks.
FEN: 3r3r/pbpk4/2p3p1/2PpPp1p/5P1P/1P1BR3/P5P1/4K2R w K - 0 24; Commentary: Black must stop h4-h5,when the black position would be fatally stretched. But now g6 appears as aweakness, along with combinative themes - which end up happening.
FEN: 3r4/pbpk4/2p3pr/2PpPp1p/1P3P1P/3B2R1/P5P1/4K2R b K - 0 25; Commentary: White must not allow ...a5, which would give Black some counterplayand the chance to exchange the bishops on a6. Now Kasparov's plan is clear - hewill bring a rook to a3, keeping the a-pawn under attack, improve his positionby bringing the king to d4, and then double the rooks on the g-file, withunbearable pressure.
FEN: 3r4/pbp5/2p1k1pr/2PpPp1p/1P3P1P/3B2R1/P5P1/4K2R w K - 1 26; Commentary: Counterplay by 25... a5 does not hit the mark.
FEN: r7/1bp2k2/p1p3pr/2PpPp1p/1P3P1P/R2B2R1/P2K2P1/8 b - - 3 29; Commentary: Black is reduced to utter passivity.
FEN: r7/1bp2k2/p1p3pr/2PpPpRp/1P3P1P/R1KB4/P5P1/8 b - - 7 31; Commentary: Of course, with Black having nothing to do, White makes all improvementspossible before springing into action.
FEN: r6r/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/R1PpPpRp/1P1K1P1P/3B4/P5P1/8 w - - 16 36; Commentary: A repetition of moves here and there, when the opponent isreduced to passivity, never hurt.
FEN: r6r/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/R1PpPpRp/1P1K1P1P/8/P3B1P1/8 b - - 17 36; Commentary: Now White's winning plan uses thebishop on this square, for tactical reasons.
FEN: rr6/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/R1PpPpRp/1P1K1P1P/8/P3B1P1/8 w - - 18 37; Commentary: This losesimmediately. Black had to walk the tightrope with some move like 36... Rhg8,standing ready to defend the kingside or queenside at a moment's notice.However, White can switch between attacks on the a6- and g6- pawns very rapidly,combined with Zugzwang motifs and even some breakthroughs such as b4-b5 or g2-g4combined with h4-h5, if need be - so Black should not be able to defend.
FEN: rr6/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/2PpPpRp/1P1K1P1P/R7/P3B1P1/8 b - - 19 37; Commentary: White immediately attacks the g6-pawn, which for tactical reasons is notdefensible.
FEN: 6rr/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/2PpPpRB/1P1K1P1P/6R1/P5P1/8 b - - 0 39; Commentary: Capturing on h5will be met by e6+, deflecing the king.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1ppqp1p/b1p3p1/3nP3/2P5/1P6/P3QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: This time Karpov prepares to attack e5 and castle kingside, ifWhite develops normally.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1ppqp1p/b1p3p1/3nP3/2P2P2/1P6/P3Q1PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: But Kasparov uses this sharp move - sharp,because by virtue of threatening to solidly defend e5 and stifle Black, heforces Black into action.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1ppq2p/b1p2pp1/3nP3/2P2P2/1P6/P3Q1PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11; Commentary: Thus Black begins to create counterthreats.We will see the move 10...Qb4+ later, in the game Kasparov-Bacrot, Sarajevo2000.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp1q1p/b1p2pp1/3nP3/2P2P2/BP6/P3Q1PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 12; Commentary: Of course the queen must not go to e6 because then cxd5would attack it.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp1q1p/b1p2pp1/3nP3/2P2P2/BP6/P2Q2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 3 12; Commentary: It might look nice to make a discovered check anddisplace the black king, but this is not the position to open the e-file.
FEN: r3kb1r/p1pp1q1p/bnp2pp1/2P1P3/5P2/BP6/P2Q2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 13; Commentary: A very important tactical idea in this line. Sometimes Black is castledqueenside when this happens, and the pawn reaches a7! However, here there aresome alternatives for White.
FEN: r3kb1r/2pp1q1p/1pp2pp1/4P3/5P2/BP6/P2Q2PP/RN2Kb1R w KQkq - 0 15; Commentary: Black decides tosacrifice a piece. Instead 14...Ba6 15.bxc7 would be risky - Black's darksquares, such as d6, would become very weak, and the c7-pawn remains as athreat. Alternatively he could try 14...Bxa3, which might be best.
FEN: r3kb1r/2pp1q1p/1pp1Ppp1/8/5P2/BP6/P2Q2PP/RN2Kb1R b KQkq - 0 15; Commentary: A nice idea - White weakens c6in anticipation of what happens in the game. If White captured the bishopsimmediately it was unlikely he could win the game.
FEN: 3rkB1r/2p2q1p/1pp1ppp1/8/5P2/1P6/PQ4bP/RN2K2R w KQk - 0 18; Commentary: With this desperado Blackmakes sure to get a second pawn for the piece, although it is not enough - evenif White must be a bit careful to consolidate. Keeping the opposite-coloredbishops on the board would be more complicated, but White should be betteranyway.
FEN: 3r1k1r/2p2q1p/1pQ1ppp1/8/5P2/1P6/P6P/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 19; Commentary: Now it remainsto consolidate - the two pawns are not enough for White's knight.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2pPp3/2P4B/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9; Commentary: It was possible to prevent 9...Bf5 with moves such as 9.Qc2 or 9.Bd3, but Spassky isn't concerned apparently.
FEN: r2qk2r/pp1n1p2/3p1nbp/2pPp1p1/2P1P3/2P2PB1/P2N2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 13; Commentary: From 4.Bg5 the play might become sharp and tactical (as wehave seen) or this kind of locked, maneuvering struggle might develop. White hasmore space, but it can be difficult to break through.
FEN: r4rk1/3nqpn1/1p1p2bp/p1pPp1p1/P1P1P1P1/2PB1P2/3N1B1P/RQ2K2R b KQ - 0 19; Commentary: Preventing ...f5, which isabsolutlely crucial. Now the knight on g7 might turn out to be poor for sometimel, while White can still open lines with h2-h4. Although it would seem thatBlack can defend the one open file, it is not so easy in practice. White alsohas the f5 square to use and prospects of an invasion on the queenside. All inall, Black faces a thankless defense.
FEN: r4rk1/3nqpn1/1p1p2b1/p1pPp1pp/P1P1P1P1/2PB1P2/3N1B1P/RQ2K2R w KQ - 0 20; Commentary: Perhaps Black should evacuatethe king immediately by 19...f6 20.h4 Kf7.
FEN: r4rk1/3nq1n1/1p1p1pb1/p1pPp1pp/P1P1P1PP/2PB1P2/5B2/RQ2KN1R b KQ - 1 21; Commentary: Spassky improves the knight, which will head to f5.
FEN: 6r1/3nqkn1/1p1p1p1r/p1pPpPpp/P1P1P2P/2PB1P2/3K1B2/RQ5R w - - 1 26; Commentary: One might imagine that the blockedposition would favor Black's two knights against White's bishops. However, bothknights are passive and have no reasonable route to a good square. Meanwhile,White's dark-squared bishop has reasonable prospects on the kingside, while itis also hard for Black to defend squares like b5 and c6.
FEN: 4n3/3nkq2/1p1p1p2/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P3/2P1BP2/3KB1Q1/8 b - - 0 37; Commentary: Despite the trade of the rooks,Black's defense is not any easier. The knights still have no prospects, whileBlack must defend against invasions on both sides of the board.
FEN: 8/3nk1nq/1p1p1p2/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P2Q/2P1BP2/4B2K/8 b - - 12 43; Commentary: The king blocksthe h-pawn and covers the few possible squares which could give Blackcounterplay on the g-file.
FEN: 8/3nk1nq/1p1p1p2/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P3/2P1BP2/4B2K/6Q1 b - - 24 49; Commentary: White could not make progress on the queenside, sohe switches back to the kingside.
FEN: 8/3n1knq/1p1p1p2/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P2K/2P1BP2/8/5BQ1 b - - 30 52; Commentary: The bishop finds a more relevant diagonal.
FEN: 8/3n1knq/1p1p1p2/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P2K/2P1BP1B/8/6Q1 w - - 33 54; Commentary: Blackfinally cracks, allowing the decisive 54.Qg6+. He had to leave everything whereit was and move the king back and forth.
FEN: 6k1/3n2nq/1p1p1pQ1/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P2K/2P1BP1B/8/8 w - - 35 55; Commentary: Trading queens, of course, allows 55.fxg6+ when the knight on d7 is underattack.
FEN: 6k1/3n2n1/1p1p1pqB/p1pPpP1p/P1P1P2K/2P2P1B/8/8 w - - 0 56; Commentary: Taking on g6 is completely hopeless. The best chance wasto bury the queen with 55...Qh8.
FEN: 6k1/8/1p1p1pPK/p1pP1P2/P1n1PB2/2P5/8/8 b - - 1 62; Commentary: The knight is cut off, and next comes g7 followed byKg6xf6, et cetera.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/5n1p/2pPp3/2P4B/2P5/P3PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: It isaccepted that Black should play 7...d6 first, to prevent Spassky's next move.There is no benefit from playing ...e5 first anyway.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/3P1n1p/2p1p3/2P4B/2P5/P3PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: This pawn will be an unpleasant\"nail\" for Black to deal with - his queenside and kingside lose their abilityto communicate.
FEN: r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2nP1n1p/2p1p1p1/2P4B/2P5/P1Q1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: Another major problem that 8.d6 created forBlack was that the pin on the h4-d8 diagonal can hardly be broken except by thismove, which - however - means permanent weaknesses.
FEN: r1b1k2r/pp1p1p2/2nP1n1p/q1p1p1p1/2P5/2P3B1/P1Q1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 2 11; Commentary: This putsthe queen seriously out of play. Black should instead prefer 10.. .b6,developing the light-squared bishop, or 10...Nh5.

FEN: r1b1k2r/pp1p1p2/3n3p/2p1N1p1/2P5/q1P5/P1Q1PPPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq - 0 15; Commentary: Black finally managed to get rid of that pawn, but his position is full ofweaknesses and his pieces do not coordinate.

FEN: rn1qk2r/pb3p2/3p1n1p/1PpPp1p1/1b6/2NBP1B1/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 11; Commentary: Black could actually play10... Nxd5 right away, and it was better to do so, although after 11.Ne2 Whitewould still have a better position.

FEN: rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4; Commentary: The Leningrad Variation - White answersBlack's pin with a pin of his own. The question will be - will White miss thebishop from the queenside, or will Black find himself under pressure (or forcedto weaken himself) by the pin?
FEN: rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/4pn1p/6B1/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: It was long considered that Blackshould take the opportunity to chase the bishop to h4, but nowadays many playersavoid this move in order to try to exploit the position of the bishop tactically(by a ...Ne4 move, for instance).
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/2p5/1bPP3B/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: It is logical and practicallynecessary to attack the center this way, emphasizing the bishop's absense fromthe queenside. Otherwise, White plans a setup with e3, Bd3 and Nge2 - an idealposition.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/2pP4/1bP4B/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: This irruptive move is typical of the variation.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/5n1p/2pp4/1bP4B/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: Black decides to trade in the center - one of the systems which can be used.However, now a subsequent ...Bxc3 won't double the white pawns. Alternatives are6...Bxc3+ followed by 7...d6 (or 7...e5, as we will see in a later game) or thepawn sacrifice 7...b5!?.

FEN: r1bqk2r/pp1n1pp1/3p1n1p/1BpP4/1b5B/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9; Commentary: Spassky is notworried about having to give up the two bishops, and plans to meet 9...Qa5 with10.Bxd7+ followed by 11.Ne2. But later he came to the conclusion that 9.Bd3could be played, meeting 9...Qa5 with a promising pawn sacrifice 10.Ne2 Nxd511.0-0. This became the main line.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/1BpPn3/1b5B/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 11; Commentary: A typical method to break the pin - the black knight goes tog6.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPn3/8/2b1P1N1/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 16; Commentary: Black considers that the bishop will be useless on the queenside andtrades it off, although it was possible to play other moves.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPn3/7q/2P1P1N1/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 17; Commentary: Itlooks like a good kind of Benoni (at least the central structure), where Blackhas traded some pieces and has no weakness of the kingside. However, lookingcloser you see that Black lacks the usual counterplay while White's centralpawns can become a dangerous force.
FEN: r4rk1/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pP4/5Pbq/2P1P1N1/P5PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 19; Commentary: Better than18...Qxg4, after which the ending would be worse for Black. But after White'snext move, Black's pieces prove to be awkward as well.
FEN: r4rk1/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pP4/Q4Pbq/2P1P1N1/P5PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 19; Commentary: Whitecreates some unpleasant threats on the fourth rank - for instance, f4-f5,creating a strong pin. Meanwhile, White prevents the bishop from going to itsmost natural square on d7.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pP4/Q3PP1q/2P3N1/P5PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 20; Commentary: The pawns storm forward. Blackfaces a difficult defense. Additionally, in this position the knight is strongerthan the bishop.
FEN: r1b2rk1/pp3pp1/3p4/2pP3p/4PPq1/2P3N1/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 22; Commentary: Smyslov fights back with resolve. Theadvance of the h-pawn will mean that at least White doesn't have an easy life.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p4pp1/3p4/1ppP3p/4PPq1/2P3N1/P1Q2RPP/R5K1 w - - 0 23; Commentary: Black could play 22...h4 right away, but the answer would be thesame.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p4pp1/3p4/1ppPP3/5Pqp/2P5/P1Q2RPP/R4NK1 b - - 1 24; Commentary: The knight couldn't go to e4 due to the pin 24...Bf5.Nevertheless, it will be perfectly good on e3.
FEN: r4rk1/p4pp1/8/1ppPpb2/5Pqp/2P5/P2Q1RPP/R4NK1 w - - 0 26; Commentary: Blackis holding, but he must walk on a tightrope. This move, however, iscapitulation, allowing the opening of the f-file. Black had to play somethinglike 25...Rfe8.
FEN: r4rk1/p4pp1/6b1/1ppPP3/6qp/2P5/P2Q1RPP/R4NK1 w - - 1 27; Commentary: The threatwas 27.Ne3 (which was not as big a threat when the f-file was closed). But nowthe bishop is out of the fight against White's center pawns.
FEN: r4rk1/p4pp1/3P2b1/1pp1P3/6q1/2P4p/P2Q1RPP/4RNK1 b - - 0 28; Commentary: Probably the immediate 28. Ne3 was even better, not giving the queen theopportunity to go to e6.
FEN: r4rk1/p4pp1/3Pq3/1pp1P3/4bR2/2P1N2p/P2Q2PP/4R1K1 b - - 4 30; Commentary: Now White chases thebishop to gain the f5 square for his knight.
FEN: r4rk1/p4pp1/3Pq3/1pp1PN2/5R2/2P4p/P2Q2bP/4R1K1 b - - 1 31; Commentary: White had no intention of capturing the bishop,which does not coordinate with Black's other pieces. Instead the knight leapsin, with an immediate threat of 32.Ne7+ followed by 33.Rh4+.
FEN: r3r1k1/p4pp1/3Pq3/1pp1PN2/5R2/2P4p/P2Q2bP/4R1K1 w - - 2 32; Commentary: Blackwill be more than happy to capture the knight if it goes to e7. If instead31...g6, then the clearest win is 32.Rh4!, meeting 32...gxf5 (or 32...Qxf533.Qh6) with 33.Rh6!, forcing Black to give up the queen.
FEN: r3r1k1/p4pp1/3Pq3/1pp1PN2/5R2/2P1R2p/P2Q2bP/6K1 b - - 3 32; Commentary: Another piece enters the attack.
FEN: 3rr1k1/p4pp1/3Pq3/1pp1PN2/5R2/2P1R2p/P2Q2bP/6K1 w - - 4 33; Commentary: Black is completely helpless. For instance, if 32...g6 then 33.Nh6+ followed by34.Rxf7+; or if 32...Qd5 then White can trade queens followed by Ne7+, remainingwith a pawn on e7.
FEN: 3rr1k1/p4pN1/3Pq3/1pp1P3/5R2/2P1R2p/P2Q2bP/6K1 b - - 0 33; Commentary: This knightsacrifice blasts open the king position and opens the road for White's rooks andqueen to enter.
FEN: 4r1k1/p4pN1/3rq3/1pp1P3/5R2/2P1R2p/P2Q2bP/6K1 w - - 0 34; Commentary: A desperate move which, however, had to be takeninto account as there is only one refutation. Taking the knight woulddemonstrate the huge amount of force White has gathered.
FEN: 4r1k1/p4p2/3rN3/1pp1P3/5R2/2P1R2p/P2Q2bP/6K1 b - - 0 34; Commentary: Now taking the white queen allows35.Rg3+ followed by 36.Rh4#, so Smyslov resigned.
FEN: rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Not a common move, but logical in a way.Black transforms the game into a Benoni with the inclusion of a3 and ...b6.There are indeed quite a few lines of the Benoni where ...b6 is a useful move,while White usually ends up playing a4, not a3. Nevetheless, White can try toaim for lines where this difference is not relevent, and also try to show thateven an improved Benoni is still not good enough...
FEN: rnbqk2r/p2p1pbp/1p3np1/2pP4/8/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8; Commentary: It is worth thinking about playing the more normal 7...d6, when 8.Bg5can be met in the normal way, by 8...h6 followed by 9...g5 and 10...Nh5. Butsurely the result of the game should not depend on that?
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p2p1pbp/1p3np1/2pP2B1/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9; Commentary: White adopts a restrained setup which ispopular nowadays as well (although usually with the white bishop on f4).Nevertheless, in only four moves White ends up playing e3-e4 anyway.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/p4pbp/1p1p1np1/2pP2B1/8/P1N1P3/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 10; Commentary: Preventing the freeing exchange ...Bg4xf3 as well as the...h6/...g5/... Nh5 idea, while heading for the key c4-square.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p4pb1/np1p1npp/2pP4/7B/P1N1P3/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 12; Commentary: This knight development is quite normal in the Benoni, and its adoptionhere is particularly logical since ...b6 is usually played by Black in thissetup. Meanwhile, the slow way White has played, with e3 instead of e4, seems tomake the choice of ...Na6 even more logical. But throughout the rest of the gamewe constantly see the defect of this position of the knight.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p1n2pb1/1p1p1npp/2pP4/4P2B/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 13; Commentary: Apparently another loss of a tempo, but White needs to guard d5.
FEN: r1bq1rk1/p1n2pb1/3p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 14; Commentary: Apparently Black has achieved his goals in a Benoni. The ...b5 advance has beenmade, and additionally White lost a tempo by playing e4 in two moves rather thanone. But it is very hard to understand how Black went wrong in the coming movesand why he was quickly crushed! To begin with, we can talk about the inclusionof ...b6 and a3 again. Here the a3 move is helping to prevent a quick ...b4,while ...b6 turns out to be irrelevent because Black played ...b5 anyway.Normally Black plays ...b6 in this system with the knight on c7, but usuallyonly after White plays a2-a4. So in a way it could be claimed that White hasadopted a superior setup by not trying to stop ...b5 and instead using the extramove a3 afterwards. Well this is all complicated, but ultimately Black's problemis the misplaced knight on c7 - having achieved ... b5 without opposition, theknight there has no purpose  and is inactive.
FEN: r1b2rk1/p1nq1pb1/3p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 15; Commentary: A natural setup,unpinning the knight and preparing to develop the bishop somewhere on either b7or a6. Perhaps, though, a case could be made for 14...Bd7, when the bishopbetter controls squares like b5 and a4, in preparation for an eventual ...b4advance.
FEN: r1b1r1k1/p1nq1pb1/3p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N5/1PQNBPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 5 16; Commentary: Petrosian's play is very quiet and onlyconcerned with restricting his opponent's possibilities and strengthening keypoints. Only if Black does nothing will he slowly go over the the attack.
FEN: r3r1k1/pbnq1pb1/3p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N5/1PQNBPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 6 17; Commentary: A move which might be questioned, since the bishop normally has fewprospects here. However, Black needs to connect the rooks and finishdevelopment. It would be nice to play ...a5 and ...Ba6, but the problem is thatthe immediate 16...a5 can be met by 17.a4, punching holes in the queenside.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bnq1pb1/p2p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N4P/1PQNBPP1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 18; Commentary: Black couldn't find anything positive to do, so he makes this basicallyuseful move, maintaining the position. It can be said that there is littledifference between this and Petrosian's last move (17.h3). But it turns out thatBlack needs to act considerably more hastily. In fact, the 17.h3 move was apreparation for f2-f4 (white defends against ...Ng4). Here 17...c4 wasrecommended, since Larsen played that next move. Another possibility was 17...g5followed by the doubling of the rooks on the e-file.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bnq1pb1/p2p1npp/1ppP4/4PP1B/P1N4P/1PQNB1P1/R3R1K1 b - - 0 18; Commentary: It had seemed that White placed little emphasison the central breakthrough in his previous moves. But with surprising speedBlack finds himself doing contortions to prevent e4-e5. It turns out thatPetrosian has just put his pieces on the right squares, while some of Larsen'sare misplaced.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bnq1pb1/p2p1np1/1p1P3p/2p1PP1B/P1N2B1P/1PQN2P1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Black needs to be ready for ... Nh7 inorder to allow the bishop to control e5, so he must prevent Bg4 in response.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bnq1pbn/p2p2p1/1p1PP2p/2p2P1B/P1N2B1P/1PQN2P1/3RR1K1 b - - 0 21; Commentary: Although Black has control of e5, White is able to makethis breakthrough anyway. It is very unusual how White's quiet play has led to aposition where the fierce breakthrough is decisive.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bnq1pbn/p5p1/1p1Pp2p/2p1NP1B/P1N2B1P/1PQ3P1/3RR1K1 b - - 1 22; Commentary: Thepoint. Nc5 followed by capturing the Bb7 and then d5-d5 is threatened, and Blackfinds it very difficult to prevent this. In the meantime, White is also aimingat f6.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bn2pbn/p5p1/1p1Ppq1p/2p1NP1B/P1N2B1P/1PQ3P1/3RR1K1 w - - 2 23; Commentary: Black tries to be more active, but this just multiplies hisproblems. Necessary was 22...Bf8, although the position after 23.d6 Ne6 24.fxe5is hardly pretty.
FEN: r3r1k1/1bn2pbn/p5p1/1p1Ppq1p/2p1NP1B/P1N2B1P/1P3QP1/3RR1K1 b - - 3 23; Commentary: A crushing move.White unpins the Ne4, thus threatening 24.Nd6, while also preparing Qb6.
FEN: 3rr1k1/1bn2pbn/p5p1/1p1Ppq1p/2p1NP1B/P1N2B1P/1P3QP1/3RR1K1 w - - 4 24; Commentary: Desperation.

FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: Of course, Black could have played 4...Bb4, but perhaps he did not want to play this line of the Nimzo-Indian (with ...b6)? Now, however, if White plays 5.g3 then 5...Bb4 is a good line.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Petrosian plays his trademark move, just preventing ...Bb4, rather than makinga commital move like 5.Bg5 (which could be met by 5...Be7 and an eventual...Ne4).
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: This move is most logical when Black has already played...Bb7. If White had played a3 on move four then Black would have a variety ofalternative lines when the bishop is left on c8 for the time being.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: This is still one of the main lines of the Petrosian Variation. Black doesnot want to be left with a blocked pawn on d5 after 6...exd5. The resultingcentral structure, typical of the Exchange Variation of the Queen's GambitDeclined, would allow White to use an alternative development and emphasize theweakness on the c-file.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: White slowly builds up power in thecenter. The advance e3-e4 will eventually come, and the position will start tolook like a Gruenfeld, with White gaining attacking chances on the kingside.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/1B1n4/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8; Commentary: White inserts this check to induce ...c6, blocking the bishopon b7, at least temporarily.
FEN: rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2pn4/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10; Commentary: Smyslov goes to make thisfreeing advance right away. However, nowadays Black would first develop with...0-0 and maybe ...Nd7. Petrosian shows that, contrary to appearances, it isrisky to open the game so soon.
FEN: rn2k2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2pq4/3P4/P2BPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11; Commentary: Of course Black could play10...exd5, leading to the structure discussed before. However, in such positionsthe exchange of a pair of minor pieces can only help White, so it would not beso logical.
FEN: rn2k2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2q5/8/P2BPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12; Commentary: Black looks active, and even if the queen has tomove again, it doesn't seem like it could be such a big problem. But Petrosianshows that there are indeed some problems. Meanwhile, if 11...Bxc5 then 12.e4blots out the light squared bishop and leads to an ideal development for White.
FEN: r3k2r/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2q5/8/P2BPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 13; Commentary: After this move Black starts to experience some realproblems. Probably Smyslov avoided the natural 12...0-0 because of 13.Bb4, butit doesn't look so dangerous after 13...Qc7. Instead Black finds his queen moreexposed, while the knight is also not on the best square.
FEN: r3k2r/pb2bppp/1pnqp3/8/8/P2BPN2/1P1B1PPP/2RQK2R w Kkq - 4 14; Commentary: The queencouldn't go to h5, since already 14.Qa4 wins material due to the pin.

FEN: 1r2r1k1/2q3bp/p2p2p1/PppP1b1n/2B3P1/1Q3P2/1P5P/R1BN1RK1 w - b6 0 20; Commentary: The play heats up on all parts of theboard. Now not only will Black create threats through the center towards thesomewhat drafty White king, but the rook will also take part on the b-file anddrive the white king away from the defense.
FEN: 4r1k1/2q3bp/pr1p2p1/2pP1b1n/2B3P1/5P2/QP5P/R1BN1RK1 b - - 1 21; Commentary: 21.Qa3 waspossible, but after 21...Rb4 White would have to resort to the move 22.b3, afterwhich the queen is nevertheless cut off from the defense (of course Black willresist the urge to capture the rook in that event).

FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/n2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 7 11; Commentary: In these basic main lines, Black has two viableapproaches - the move ...a6 combined with ...Nbd7, planning ...Ne5 and play onthe kingside; or ...Na6, bringing the knight to c7 to prepare ...b5. Kingsideplay is not ruled out in the latter approach though, as we will see.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/p1n2pbp/1p1p2p1/2pP4/P3P1n1/2N4P/1PQNBPP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 14; Commentary: There could be no doubting what Tal hadplanned in response to this move, but Gugenidze played it anyway. A case ofputting one's hand in the tiger's mouth. Presumably, though, he missed Tal's17th move. Playable was 14.Nc4.
FEN: r1b1r1k1/p1n2pbp/1p1p2p1/2pP4/P3P2q/2N4P/1PQNB1P1/R1B1RK2 b - - 2 16; Commentary: 16.g3 Bd4+mates.

FEN: r1b1r1k1/p1n2p1p/1p1p2p1/2pP4/P2bP3/7q/1PQNB1P1/R1BNRK2 w - - 0 18; Commentary: White cannot take the queen since if18.gxh3 Bxh3 is mate. So Black manages to gain a second pawn for the piece whilebreaking in and removing a crucial defender. Now it is clear that the attack wilbe overwhelming.
FEN: r1b1r1k1/p1n2p1p/1p1p2p1/2pP4/P2bP3/5B1q/1PQN2P1/R1BNRK2 b - - 1 18; Commentary: Opening the e2 square for the king.
FEN: r1b1r1k1/p1n4p/1p1p2p1/2pP1p2/P2bP3/4NB2/1PQN2Pq/R1B1RK2 w - - 0 20; Commentary: Applying more pressure and opening more lines.
FEN: r3r1k1/p1n4p/bp1p2p1/2pP4/P1NbB3/4N3/1PQ3Pq/R1B1RK2 w - - 1 22; Commentary: The two bishops blazing toward the king along with the open e- and f- filesgive Black a decisive attack.
FEN: 4r1k1/p6p/bp1p2p1/2pnr3/P1Nb4/R3NB2/1PQB2Pq/4RK2 w - - 0 25; Commentary: Havingbrought in all his pieces, Tal strikes and the white position just collapses.
FEN: 4r1k1/p6p/bp1p2p1/2pr4/P1Nb4/R3N3/1PQBK1Pq/4R3 b - - 1 26; Commentary: Of course 26.Nxd5 is met by 26...Qg1#.
FEN: 4r1k1/p6p/1p1p2p1/2pr4/P1b5/4R3/1PQBK1Pq/4R3 w - - 0 28; Commentary: 28.Qxc4 is met by 28...Qxg2+29.Kd1 Qxd2#, so White resigned.
FEN: rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8; Commentary: This is still considered a dangerous attacking system, although it has notbecome one of the critical lines against the Benoni. The basic plan of attack isdemonstrated in this game. The knight goes to the g3 square, where it seems tobe stymied by the g6-pawn.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10; Commentary: Later an interesting idea with9. ..Ng4 was developed. Besides developing the Nb8 on d7 as in this game, Blackcan also play 9...Na6, with the knight going to c7 to support ...b5.
FEN: 1rb1r1k1/2qn1pbp/3p2p1/1pnP4/2p1PP2/2N1B1NP/1PB2QP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 19; Commentary: Tal has just been doing his usual thing, which we saw in someearlier games. The ...c4 advance was achieved, then the knight to c5, and ...b5.He is ready to start crashing through on the queenside with ...b4, et cetera,and probably thought this was another routine game with a player not of hisclass. But now Penrose shows the point of White's setup.
FEN: 1rb1r1k1/2qn1pbp/3p2p1/1pnPP3/2p2P2/2N1B1NP/1PB2QP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 19; Commentary: The e5square was well guarded, but White can make this powerful pawn sacrifice,sealing that square and gaining an attack on the kingside.
FEN: 1rb1r1k1/2qn1pbp/6p1/1pnPpP2/2p5/2N1B1NP/1PB2QP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 20; Commentary: The point. Now the e5-square is closed, the e4-square beckons for a knight, andWhite has powerful threats on the kingside. Tal did not last much longer.
FEN: rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 9; Commentary: White should play h3 on either this or - preferably - the last move.That would lead to one of the main systems to combat the Benoni today. Insteadhe allows the ...Bg4xf3 exchange.
FEN: r4rk1/1pqn1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2NB3P/1P2QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 4 14; Commentary: The queen does not belong on the e-file, where there willbe pressure.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1pqn1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P1B1P3/2N4P/1P2QPPB/R4RK1 b - - 8 16; Commentary: Stopping the ...c5-c4 advance forthe moment, but White won't be able to maintain this.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1pq2pbp/p2p1np1/2pPn3/P1B1PP2/2N4P/1P2Q1PB/R4RK1 b - - 0 17; Commentary: Whiteshould play more modestly - this seriously weakens e4, while there is no hope ofsome kind of attack with e4-e5 on the horizon.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1pqn1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P1Q1PP2/2N4P/1P4PB/R4RK1 w - - 1 19; Commentary: Theknight shifts around, opening the bishop from g7 and controlling the e5-square.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1p1n1pbp/pq1p2p1/2pP4/P1Q1PP2/2N4P/1P4PB/R3R1K1 w - - 3 20; Commentary: Like in the game with Mititelu, the queen enters the fray,creating annoying threats to b2.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/PqQ1PP2/2N4P/1P4PB/1R2R1K1 w - - 5 21; Commentary: And due to the serioius pressureon the queenside and e4, White cannot trade queens - the knight will be drivenfrom c3, followed by ...Rc2, and so on.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/3P4/Pqp1PP2/2N4P/1P4PB/1R2RQK1 w - - 0 22; Commentary: Black achieves the ...c5-c4advance, opening c5 for the knight, which aims now at d3.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/3n1p1p/3p2p1/1p1P4/1qp1PP2/2b4P/1P2R1PB/1R3Q1K w - - 0 25; Commentary: Tal decides that the trade of this bishop is the easiest wayto break down White's position.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/3n1p1p/3p2p1/1R1P4/2p1PP2/3q3P/4R1PB/5Q1K w - - 1 27; Commentary: Pinning the rook,attacking e4, and freeing the c4-pawn. Despite material equality, White iscompletely helpless.
FEN: 2r1r1k1/5p1p/3p2p1/2nP4/4PP2/2pq3P/4R1PB/1R2Q2K w - - 2 29; Commentary: 29.Rc1 can be met by 29...c2, for instance. Thee4-pawn is falling and White's position is caving in, so Donner resigned.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1n2PB2/2N2N2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 10 12; Commentary: This is connected with Black's nextmove; however, even if Black does not play the following (dubious) piecesacrifice, 11...Nb4 can still be played - at a minimum White will have to burythe queen on b1 and play the useless a3 move to chase the knight back, not tomention that there will be some other inconveniences.
FEN: r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/1n2nB2/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/RQ3RK1 w - - 0 13; Commentary: Withthis move Tal intimidated his opponent and took control of the game, but in thecold light of day the move is not correct. Better was 12...Qe7.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/3B2p1/2pn1b2/4N3/8/PP1NBPPP/RQ3RK1 b - - 0 15; Commentary: With this, Averbakh just accepts a lost position.Best was 15. Bg5.
FEN: r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/3B1np1/2p2b2/4N3/8/PP1NBPPP/RQ3RK1 w - - 1 16; Commentary: Now all of White'spieces are hanging and pinned. He cannot maintain his extra piece, and can onlyrecover one of his pawns.
FEN: r3r1k1/pp3pbp/3q2p1/2p5/4B3/8/PP3PPP/RQ3RK1 w - - 0 19; Commentary: Ultimatelythis position is hopeless. Not only is Black up a pawn, but he has the excellentsupport point for the bishop on d4, with pressure on both sides of the board.The presence of opposite colored bishops will not save White.
FEN: r3r1k1/1pqn1pb1/p2p1npp/3P4/P1p1PB2/2N2B1P/1PQ2PP1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 17; Commentary: While it might appear that White has created a solid position, Talshows the road forward for Black to create rich counterplay.

FEN: 2r3k1/1p3pb1/p2p2pp/P2P4/2q2B2/5Q1P/1P3PP1/R5K1 b - - 1 23; Commentary: White should have allowed the queenexchange, with a drawable ending. Instead he missed Tal's next move.
FEN: 2r3k1/1p3pb1/p2p2pp/P2P4/1q3B2/5Q1P/1P3PP1/R5K1 w - - 2 24; Commentary: A geometric move, closely linked withthe remaining silhouettes of the Benoni structure: at a stroke, Black defendsthe standard weakness on d6 while pressuring the long diagonal and the fourthrank.
FEN: 2r3k1/1p3pb1/p2p2pp/P2P4/1q3B2/6QP/1P3PP1/R5K1 b - - 3 24; Commentary: White is losing a pawn regardless, with Black maintaining a goodstructure.
FEN: rn1q1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P1b1/2NB1N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11; Commentary: Nowadays it is accepted that White should try to prevent this move byeither h3 or an early Nd2.
FEN: rn1q1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1Q1P/1P3PP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12; Commentary: White has the two bishops, butthis position is not one where they are particularly valuable. Although it isnot really a closed position, it is a position where control of specific squaresmatters a lot. Meanwhile, White can hardly hope to \"open\" the position more,without Black's pieces developing great activity.
FEN: r3r1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/q1pPn3/P3PB2/2N4P/1P1QBPP1/R4RK1 w - - 9 17; Commentary: Black flings the queen over to b4, where itpressures e4, b2, and supports the advances ...b5 and ...c4.
FEN: r3r1k1/3n1pbp/p2p1np1/1ppP2B1/Pq2P3/2NB3P/1P1Q1PP1/4RRK1 w - - 0 20; Commentary: A key advance in the Benoni. Now if White plays 20.axb5Black can respond with 20...c4 followed by 21...axb5.
FEN: 1r2r1k1/5pbp/pn1p1np1/q2P4/Ppp1PPP1/5Q1P/1PB2B2/3NRR1K w - - 3 29; Commentary: Black has wandered slightly in the last few moves, but there is not muchWhite can undertake anyway.

FEN: rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/PBN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9; Commentary: This slow move, and the two thatfollow, cannot really be recommended for white. The f3-e4 structure is ingeneral too slow (if it isn't and English Attack) when white has castled short.This game is an example of black using the Queenside Minority Attack, and usingtimely maneuvers (Ne5-c4, Bf8-g6-Bg7, etc) to slowly improve the position. Whitemakes no real effort to challenge the Scheveningen structure via normal plans,and is outplayed.
FEN: r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/3NP3/PBN1BP2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12; Commentary: The \"Schev\" development of the Knight instead of a Najdorfdevelopment makes total sense here. White has no real chances to play on theKingside anymore and bringing the knight to c5 isn't as effective with white'sover defense of the e4 pawn.

FEN: rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3; Commentary: Now we see that White has two pawns in the center and Black"only" has one. That is why the French Defence is also classified as a"semi-open" game.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3; Commentary: [%csl Gc3][%cal Gc3d5,Gc3e4] The most logical move,placing the knight on a square where he exerts max influence, but making itvulnerable to the Bb4 pin. The alternative is to put it to the "more passive"d2 square with 3 Nd2, leading to the Tarrasch variation, which will beexamined slightly later. The debate revolving around 3 Nc3 and 3 Nd2 (whetherone move is better or another) has been raging forever among those trying tobeat the French and general verdict is that 3 Nc3 is more critical, but alsomore double-edged.
FEN: rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4; Commentary: Pinning the knight - the starting point of theWinawer variation.

FEN: rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: By far the most common move, although notthe only one.

FEN: rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: A fascinatingAlekhine-Chatard attack, where White sacrifices a pawn to open the h-file forhis rook. General verdict is that this is rather dangerous for Black.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3; Commentary: As mentioned earlier, this is the alternative to Nc3.White doesn't allow the annoying ping with Bb4 (which would be now met with c3), but his knight does not attack the d5 pawn from d2.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: Whitedoesn't have a better move than taking on e4, and it doesn't matter where hisknight initially was.

FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2; Commentary: Fischer's favourite move, leading to the so-called King'sIndian Attack formation (which can be reached from various other openings, aswell).
FEN: r1b4r/1p2kppp/pn2p3/3pP3/3N1P2/8/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 15; Commentary: One example variation of the Steinitz line. Due to his very goodknight on d4 (and the fact enemy bishop is somewhat passive), White has someslight advantage in this endgame, which he as managed to convert in many games.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p3p3/1p1pP3/2pP4/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: [%csl Ra6,Rb5,Rc4,Rd5,Re6][%cal Gc8e6,Gc8a6] I have delibaretly taken the most extreme example toillustrate the point, but you see how Black's light-squared bishop doesn'thave anywhere to go and anything to do.
FEN: rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4; Commentary: The starting point of the Rubinstein Variation.Note that Black can play this irrespective of whether the White knight is onc3 or d2 - White doesn't have a better move than recapturing himself.
