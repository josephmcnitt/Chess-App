{Just before this round, I ran into a very friendly and amicable GM Hrvoje
Stevic relaxing in the vicinity of the sea. He told me how he played Ivanchuk
once in the past. Before the game, he opened the laptop in order to prepare
for the game, saw Ivanchuk's repertoire and immediately closed the laptop,
realizing there is no point in preparing since "the man plays everything".} 1.
