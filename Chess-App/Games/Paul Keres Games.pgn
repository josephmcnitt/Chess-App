1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O d6 {[pgndiagram] The Steinitz
Defence was popular back in the day. It is doubtful how wise it was to play it
against Keres, since he also beat Alekhine in this variation in the Margate
1937 tournament} 6. Bxc6+ {Against Alekhine Keres advanced his c pawn} (6. c4 {
[pgndiagram] Was the choice against Alekhine. Preventing b5 and gaining some
space leads to different type of position}) 6... bxc6 7. d4 Nxe4 $6 {
[pgndiagram] This is probably not advisable, although there is no direct
refutation} (7... Be7 {Is more normal}) 8. Re1 f5 9. dxe5 d5 10. Nd4 {Black's
position is slightly unpleasant} c5 $2 {[pgndiagram] But this is a decisive
mistake; Black weakens his position too much} (10... Bc5 {Defending the pawn
indirectly, was neccessary} 11. c3 Qh4 12. Re2 O-O 13. f3 Ng5 14. Kh1 {
[pgndiagram] And White has a slight edge}) 11. Ne2 {White has a simple Nf4
move, thraetening the d5 and also Qh5, and it is not easy to defend against
that} c6 (11... Be7 12. Nf4 c6 13. Qh5+ {[pgndiagram] And White is probably
already winning}) 12. Nf4 g6 13. c4 $1 {[pgndiagram] Very instructive. White
has the initiative and continues to play energeticaly. Keres was very strong
when he had the tactical initiative} d4 (13... dxc4 14. Qa4 {[pgndiagram] Is
just horrible for Black}) 14. Qa4 Bb7 15. f3 Ng5 16. h4 $2 {The only slight
mistake by Keres} (16. Nd2 {Was simple and strong, intending to bring the
knight on a5} Be7 17. Nb3 O-O 18. Na5 Qc7 19. h4 {[pgndiagram] And only now h4}
) 16... Nf7 $2 (16... Nxf3+ 17. gxf3 Qxh4 {[pgndiagram] Would have allowed
Black to resist}) 17. e6 {Now Black simply loses a piece} Qxh4 (17... Nd6 18.
e7 Bxe7 19. Nd5 {[pgndiagram] Is curtains}) 18. exf7+ Kxf7 {[pgndiagram] White
still has some technique to display, but a piece is a piece. The remainder of

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Qe2 {[pgndiagram] The
so-called Worall attack. White defends the e-pawn with his queen, frees the d1
square for his rook and plans Rd1-c3-d4.  The main drawback of the move is
that the Queen is slightly exposed on this square, and Bg4 move is always
slightly annoying for White} b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. a4 {[pgndiagram] But this is very
rare move, even from today's perspective} (8. c3 Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. Rd1 O-O 11.
d3 {[pgndiagram] Constitutes the main line nowadays, with slower play, more
characteristic of the d3 Anti Berlin lines}) 8... Bg4 {This is not a pawn
sacrifice; Black is threatening Nd4} 9. c3 (9. axb5 Nd4 {Is really unpleasant})
9... O-O {[pgndiagram] But this time this really is a pawn sacrifice.. Or more
precisely a pseudo-sacrifice} 10. axb5 {Accepting the gauntlet. With hindsight,
it might have been wiser to refrain from doing it} (10. h3 {Or}) (10. d3) 10...
axb5 11. Rxa8 Qxa8 12. Qxb5 Na7 $1 {[pgndiagram] A key move that I imagine
Fine missed} 13. Qe2 (13. Qa6 Nxe4 {[pgndiagram] Is no good for White as well})
13... Qxe4 14. Qxe4 Nxe4 {[pgndiagram] Now Black has a very pleasant endgame.
He will take on f3 and spoil White's structure. This factor is more important
than the two bishops here} 15. d4 (15. Bd1 {Trying to defend against Bxf3 is
too artificial for instance} Nc5 {The knight jump to d3 is really unpleasant}

are all weak (3 islands)}) 20... Nc5 21. Nc3 Nc8 22. Re1 Kf8 23. Re2 f5 {
[pgndiagram]Not the most precise} (23... Rb4 24. Ba2 Nd3 {[pgndiagram]Would
have won the b-pawn}) 24. Nb5 Nb6 25. b3 Nxd5 26. Nd4 Nb4 27. Bd2 $2 {
[pgndiagram]A mistake} (27. Nxf5 {There was nothing wrong with taking the
f-pawn, emphasizing the drawback of it's early advance}) 27... d5 28. Bxb4 Rxb4
29. Nc6 dxc4 30. Nxb4 cxb3 {[pgndiagram] Fine possibly evaluated this endgame
wrongly. It is probably close to lost for White} 31. Nd5 Nd3 $1 {Keres plays
this phase of the game brilliantly, making use of every possible tactical idea
there is} 32. Rd2 {Obviously, White can't take the bishop} (32. Rxe7 b2) (32.
Nxe7 Nf4+) 32... b2 $1 33. Rd1 c5 $6 (33... Nc1 {WAs even easier} 34. Nc3 Bf6
35. Nb1 c5 {[pgndiagram] And White is paralyzed}) 34. Kf1 c4 {Here again, Nc1
came into consideration} 35. Rb1 Bc5 36. Ke2 Bxf2 37. Ne3 c3 {[pgndiagram]
Another very strong tactical solution and the only way to win} 38. Nc2 (38.
Kxd3 Bxe3 39. Kxc3 Bc1 {[pgndiagram] Is basically a pawn endgame in which
Black is winning}) 38... Ne1 $1 {Those escapades by Black's minor pieces
though..} 39. Na3 (39. Nxe1 Bxe1 40. Kxe1 c2 {[pgndiagram] Is too obvious...
at least from the comfort of my own home with the engine running and enjoying
Black's position}) 39... Bc5 $6 {[pgndiagram] Slightly careless} (39... Bh4 {
Was simple enough}) 40. Kxe1 $2 {Missing the chance} (40. Rxe1 {Might have
save the game} Bxa3 41. Kd3 Bb4 42. Kc2 {[pgndiagram] And the bishop is tied
to the defence of the c3 pawn; I am not certain whether Black can make any
progress here}) 40... Bxa3 {Now he has the time to put the bishop on f6 and
everything is much easier} 41. Kd1 Bd6 42. Kc2 Bxh2 43. Rh1 (43. Kxc3 Be5+ 44.
Kc2 Kf7 {[pgndiagram] Is trivial win}) 43... Be5 44. Rxh7 Kf7 45. Rh1 g5 46.
