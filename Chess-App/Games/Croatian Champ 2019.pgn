I believe that 1 d4 is his childhood love} Nf6 2. c4 c6 {Ivan has started
playing Semi-Slav regularly in recent years. In his youth, he was famous for
venturing the King's Indian - something his fans somehow always hope to see.}

weak knight} Qc4 {The best move, seeking salvation in a tough endgame} 27. Bxb7

the game extremely precisely} (29. Be3 a5 {And now White has to go for} 30. d5
