[pgndiagram] Well known position on GM level. Aronian played it as black in
2014 against Grischuk and it ended 1:0. It has many similarities with this
game.} b6 {7... e5 and c5 are the main lines here, but I guess we could write
a good book about this opening anyway} 8. h4 $5 {The idea of Garry Kasparov
from the Sinquefield Rapid and Blitz 2017. It is amazing that Gazza's ideas
are topical well after his retirement. Pushing flank pawns was always a
favourite idea of his.   This move is objectively not the strongest , but
black has to play precisely. It's clear that this position Aronian had on his
board at some point while preparing for the game since this move was played
instantly.} Bb7 9. Bg5 {The point - White intends to gain a few tempi chasing
the queen away.  It also includes a pawn sacrifice} Qf5 10. Bd3 Qa5 {Most
logical and best moves.} 11. Kf1 $1 {[pgndiagram] While this move might not be
quite obvious (especially to newer players) it's kinda logical. It's moving
king from e1 do a5 diagonal stoping the potencial check after Qc3, defending
pawn on g2 and moving the king from centre.} (11. Ne2 {Would simply lose the
g2 pawn} Bxg2) 11... Nc6 $1 {A very good decision by Ding} (11... Qxc3 {Was
incredibly risky and more importantly, Aronian certainly prepared for it.} 12.

{With the threat of Bd2} Ba6 {The only move} 14. Bd2 Qa3 15. Be4 c6 16. Rh3 {
[pgndiagram] And White has a huge lead in development}) 13. Rh3 {Taking
"worthless" pawn on c3 is not worth the time it gives white to develop. And
once again Black's position is incredibly shaky - all White pieces are
participating in the game}) 12. Rb1 {Insisting on a pawn sacrifice, but maybe
it is not required} (12. Ne2 {Was safer}) 12... f6 $1 {Kicking the bishop away
and preparing for e5} (12... Qxc3 {Now Black might have taken the pawn,
because after} 13. Ne2 Qa3 14. Rh3 h6 $1 {[pgndiagram] There is no Be4 move in
the position. Still, White does have compensation for the pawn}) (12... h6 $6 {
Is inferior} 13. Bd2 O-O-O {And White is better - f6 is definitely more useful
for Black}) 13. Bd2 O-O-O 14. a4 e5 {[pgndiagram] Critical moment in the game.}

enter a long and forced variation} exd4 16. cxd4 Bb4 17. d5 Bxd2 18. Rb5 Qa6 (

this endgame is far from won - three connected passed pawns are dangerous}) (

retains some advantage}) 15... Bxc5 $1 {[pgndiagram] Exclamation mark is not
for this obvious capture, but for the follow up} (15... bxc5 16. Ne2 {Gives
White a strong attack - Qb3 is a huge threat} (16. Qb3 Ba6 17. Qe6+ Rd7) 16...

calculated piece sacrifice - Black is fighting for the initiative} 18. Be2 {

of compensation for the piece} 19. Ra5 (19. Ne2 Qxa4 20. Qxa4 Rxa4 $15 {Black
has 4 pawns for a bishop. He's slightly better and it's easier to play this
position as black.}) 19... Nxa5 20. Bxa6 Bxa6+ 21. Ke1 Rhd8 $19 {[pgndiagram]

decisive initative}) 18... Rd6 $2 {a mistake} (18... Ba8 {Was the best move
here - which would put Aronian in a rather tough spot} 19. cxd4 Nxd4 20. Rb2
Qb7 {[pgndiagram] The point - Black queen can retreat to b7. The position is
double edged, but I think it is easier to play the Black pieces and all three
results are very much possible}) (18... Bxc3 {Does not work} 19. Rxc3 Nd4 20.
Rbc5 {And wins}) 19. Rb1 $2 {Aronian fails to exploit his chance. Nerves
possibly?} (19. Rb2 {Defending d2, was quite strong} Qa5 20. cxd4 Qd5 21. dxe5
Nxe5 22. Nf3 Rhd8 $16 {[pgndiagram] This was the best way to play for a win.})
19... Qa5 20. Rb5 (20. cxd4 {Is now impossible} Qd5 21. dxe5 Nxe5 {[pgndiagram]
And both d2 and g2 are hanging - Black is almost winning here}) 20... Qa6 21.

avoid Marshall attack} b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Bb7 {More or less standard
Spanish position has arisen} 10. Nbd2 Re8 {[pgndiagram] I thought Black should
play this only after Ng5 has been ruled out} (10... h6 {Is more typical}) 11.

a tempo on h6} (11... d5 {I one of Ivanchuk's masterclasses, I have seen him

survive with a king like that}) 12. Re1 (12. f4 {Another thing I thought about
Ng5 is that it can be followed up by f4. Alas, it seems I was wrong} exf4 13.

rook will be sidelined} 14. Ngf3 g5) 12... d5 {When I was streaming, I was

play continues} Nf6 17. cxd4 Nb4 18. Qb1 $1 {[pgndiagram] Possibli this idea

decisive effect. Just look at the subsequent pendulum via c5} Nxe4 {There is
nothing else} (19... Nxd4 20. Bxf7+) 20. Rxe4 Bf6 21. Rg4 $1 {[pgndiagram] One

sacrifice on f6, and f7 pawn. Say after} Rad8 23. Ng5 {He is already winning} (

the same} Bxf3 24. gxf3 Nf5 25. Bxh6 $1 {[pgndiagram] Still works, but it is

[pgndiagram] A strong strong move from Kramnik. It seems that the addition of

nothing Black can do against the advance of the White king, so Caruana
resigned. A fantastic game by Sergey, which put him in the lead two rounds
before the end. Moreover, at this point, he had better tiebreaks than Caruana,
so in the event of them sharing the lead, he would be proclaimed as a winner. 
Last two rounds will be once again incredibly dramatic and we can only thank
FIDE they decided to supplement knock-out matches with a Candidates tournament.

1. e4 {As we have just seen, in the previous round Caruana has suffered a
devastating loss and in this game he basically had to win because his tiebreak
was inferior to Karjakin's. It is interesting he decided to go 1 e4, but he
was probably aware Aronian doesn't play the Berlin, but rather the Marshall} e5
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Voila - no Berlin} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 (5... Nxe4 {It
seems no body ventures to play the Open Ruy these days, but perhaps this is
not the time and place to talk about that}) 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. d3 {And
this has become a standard way of avoiding the Marshall these days} (8. h3 {
Doesn't quite prevent the d5 advance} Bb7 9. d3 d5 {And Black has definite
compensation. So's brilliant victory against Ivanchuk comes to mind}) (8. a4 {
Is also playable, though. I am not sure about the state of theory regarding
these two lines, but Caruana MIGHT have known a bit more than yours trully})
8... d6 9. Bd2 $5 {[pgndiagram] And this is a very interesting move,
preventing Na5 in the most direct and brutal fashion} (9. c3 Bb7 10. Nbd2 {
Would lead to a more typical Ruy Lopez}) 9... Bg4 {Also quite logical - once
Na5 is prevented, Nd4 is an option} 10. c3 {Preventing Nd4} d5 $6 {Perhaps
this is a matter of taste, but I don't like this move. The old dogma says
Black solves his problems once he carries out the d5 advance, but in the given
instance, the symmetrical pawn structure doesn't lead to immediate equality} (

It might be better than the text move} 16. Nbd2 a4 17. Bc2 Qc8 {And it is

queenside structure is once again the key}) 18. g3 $5 {Not sure about validity
of this move, but it won Caruana the game - the idea of Nh4 Nf5 is very potent}
Kh7 $2 {[pgndiagram] I think this is too passive - From this moment Aronian's
game starts going downhill} (18... Nf6 {Going for the e4 pawn once Ng3 is
impossible, was more forcing, but also more direct} 19. Be3 Nxe4 (19... Bxe3

prefers to increase the pressure}) 23... Qe6 24. Bd3 $6 {I am still not
certain whether allowing the piece sacrifice was necessary or whether the
sacrifice is fully correct} (24. Nxg6 {Was simpler - White retains a clear edge
}) 24... Bh5 $5 {Going for an interesting piece sacrifice} (24... Qd7 25. Rd1

counter Black's idea with a knight jump to f5} Nxg4 (26... Qxg4+ {Doesn't
really lead anywhere} 27. Qxg4 Nxg4 28. Be2 Nxf2 29. axb5 axb5 30. Bxb5 {
[pgndiagram] And Black doesn't have sufficient compensation for the piece}) 27.

form in this tournament. Once agian in the critical moment he fails to find a
tactical combination, in a position that usually suits his style} (31... Nxb4 {
Amazingly, but it would appear that the sacrifice of another piece, deflecting
the pawn on c3, would very much keep Black in the game} 32. cxb4 Rd4 {And it
is hard to suggest White's next move. The engine plays the extraordinary} 33.
Kh3 {But after} Qg5 {[pgndiagram] In practical game, it is incredibly hard to
play the Black pieces. So it would appear it was wrong to allow the sacrifice
and that Aronian's intuition didn't betray him.}) 32. Rh1 {[pgndiagram] Now
White is safe and sound} (32. Bxe4 {Was also working}) 32... Rd6 33. Bxe4 Rg8+

encounter. But kudos to Caruana for bravery; after finding himself in a
desperate situation, he managed to win 'to order' and now the pressure is on
Karjakin who has the White pieces tomorrow. In any case, an extremely
interesting final round awaits us tomorrow.} *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {A somewhat surprising, but perfectly logical decision,
considering the tournament situation. In contrast to the last round of the
previous Candidates Tournament where he played the Rauzer Sicilain, Caruana
opts for safety first and sticks to his guns. He decides to keep the game in
safe waters and to see how the remaining games are going to unfold with a draw
in his pocket.} 3. d4 $5 {For the first time in the tournament he has to face

battling the Petroff, but then again, everything is playable these days} 7. Bd3
c5 8. c3 Nc6 9. O-O Bg4 10. Re1 Qd7 {[pgndiagram] Okay, it is time to take the
stop and consider the situation arising out of the opening. White has a pawn
majority on the kingside, which he would very much like to advance, but it is
very hard to achieve. His pawn on e5 gives him more space, but also needs some
protection. Black on the other hand, can consider playing on the queenside,
undermining the structure with a timely f6 or advancing the center with d4. It
is hard to say whether anyone is better, but the position is not an automatic
draw} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bf4 {Overprotecting the e5 pawn. Nimzowitsch would be
proud} Qe6 {Waiting for the moment to see what White will do and placing the

closing the queenside} 19. Bc2 b5 20. a4 a6 21. f3 Bg5 (21... Nxb4 {
[pgndiagram] Was a very interesting possibility, that might give Black the
initiative. However, at this point, it was not yet neccessary to go all in, so
Caruana decided to keep it safe}) 22. Bf2 Bf4 23. Bc5 Rfd8 24. Bd6 Bg3 25. Re2

advantage} (30. Rd1 {Preventing d4, was enough to maintain equality. I guess
Grischuk's time trouble and ambition forced him to play for the win}) 30... Rd7

said he knew he was better, but not certain whether it was enough for win. I
am not sure, but I think Mamedyarov's game had already finished (or finished
very soon) so Caruana could basically offer a draw at any moment. Instead, he

a worthy challenger.} 0-1
