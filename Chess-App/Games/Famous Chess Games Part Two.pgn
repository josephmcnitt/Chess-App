Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bf4 (11. Bd2 {Is another variation, currently
more popular}) 11... Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 {Planing castling short. Black has  to
be careful about potential g4 ideas.} 13. Ne4 Qa5 14. Kb1 O-O 15. Nxf6+ (15. g4
{Is possible}) 15... Nxf6 16. Ne5 Rad8 17. Qe2 c5 $2 {[pgndiagram] This game
is perfect illustration of the typical attacking ideas in the Caro-Kann. This
move is premature as it breaks the communication between Black queen and
Black's kingside} 18. Ng6 $1 {It begins} fxg6 $2 {And this is surely a losing
move} (18... Rfe8 {Was lesser evil} 19. Nxe7+ Rxe7 20. dxc5 {And White has the
superior minor piece}) 19. Qxe6+ Kh8 20. hxg6 $3 {[pgndiagram] Introducing
fresh threats against h6 point} (20. Qxe7 Nd5 21. Bd2 Qxa2+ 22. Kxa2 Nxe7 {
Gives Black sufficient hopes of survival in the endgame}) 20... Ng8 {Seemingly
impregnating h6 forever, but..} 21. Bxh6 $3 {You will have none of that, says
the future World Champion. Every move introduces a new threat} gxh6 22. Rxh6+

Black is a piece and a rook up, but he is helpless against Qh7 threat} Nf7 {
The only way of prolonging the battle} 24. gxf7 {You can see how Black's queen
is unable to jump to h5 or somewhere} Kg7 25. Rd3 {The rook joins the attack} (
25. Qe5+ Kxf7 26. Rd3 {Was probably even stronger}) 25... Rd6 (25... Qa6 {
Giving up his queen, would have prolonged the battle further, but it wouldn't
change the evaluation} 26. Rg3+ Qg6 27. Rxg6+ Kxg6 28. d5) 26. Rg3+ Rg6 27.

this spectacular game. Not bad for a 14 year old} 1-0
