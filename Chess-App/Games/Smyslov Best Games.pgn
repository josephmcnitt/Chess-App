{Let's start our journey through the magical world of Smyslov games by
examining some of the games from his early years. Even though many associate
Smyslov's name with solid, quiet and positional play and superb endgame
technique, in his life - and especially in his youth - he has played his fair
share of wild, sharp, attacking games. --- The following game, played in
Moscow, in 1940 is a perfect example. Let's start with the very first exercise.
Can you find the move Smyslov played in the game - and the corresponding idea?

share of wild, sharp, attacking games. --- The following game, played in
Moscow, in 1940 is a perfect example.} 1. e4 {In his youth, Smyslov very often
moved the king pawn forward, but this move isn't only restricted to his youth.
For example, he ventured it in his World Championship Matches against Mikhail
Botvinnik, among other things.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 {This move
leads to the so-called Steinitz variation of the Ruy Lopez - a line that was
very popular back in the day due to its solidity. Black reinforces the e5
point and has various developing scheme to follow it up available.} 5. d4 $5 {
But this move, involving a sharp pawn sacrifice, is definitely not the most
common continuation nor the one you would expect from "harmonic and
positional" Smyslov. White strikes in the center immediately, but this
essentially gambits a pawn.} b5 6. Bb3 Nxd4 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. c3 $5 {Since White
can't really regain the pawn on d4 at once due to the exposed bishop on b3, he
has to gambit a pawn in some way. Playing c3, undermining the center and
aiming for rapid development is one possible way of doing so.} ({As mentioned,
trying to regain the pawn with} 8. Qxd4 $2 {Doesn't work due to the well-known
opening trap:} c5 9. Qd5 {[%cal Rb3f7,Rd5a8] Seemingly saving the bishop due
to the double attack, but this is only an illusion.} Be6 10. Qc6+ Bd7 11. Qd5
c4 $19 {[%cal Rc4b3] And the bishop on b3 is finally lost!}) ({Okay, White can
try to regain the pawn immediately by inserting this bishop move, but it
doesn't bring him that much advantage. After something like} 8. Bd5 Rb8 9. Bc6+
Bd7 10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 11. Qxd4 Nf6 $11 {[%csl Gf6] Black is fully developed, has
no weaknesses and is even maybe slightly preferable in this very dry and equal
position.}) 8... dxc3 {Black accepts the challenge, which is probably the most
principled way of playing.} 9. Qh5 $5 {[%csl Gd5][%cal Rh5f7,Gb1c3,Gc3d5] With
this move, White tries to create pressure against the f7 pawn while at the
same time keeping the route Nc3-Nd5 open for the knight on b1. However, this
shouldn't be too brilliant as the queen on h5 is very exposed.} (9. Qd5 {
Going to d5 involves the immediate drawing variation} Be6 10. Qc6+ Bd7 11. Qd5
Be6 $11 {When White can't really avoid the repetition.}) 9... Qe7 $6 {[%csl
Re7][%cal Re7e4,Ge7f7] It is very natural to place the queen on e7, defend the
f7 pawn and attack the e4 pawn, but it transpires that her majesty is not
ideally placed here as it gets in the way of the kingside pieces.} (9... g6 {
Including g6 is very sensible as White probably doesn't have anything better
than} 10. Qd5 Be6 11. Qc6+ Bd7 12. Qd5 {With the repetition of moves once
again.}) ({But with} 9... Qd7 {Black could have tried to fight for an
advantage. The point is that the queen doesn't hinder Black's fluent
development on the kingside. Thus after} 10. Nxc3 Nf6 11. Qe2 Be7 12. O-O O-O {
White is hard-pressed to show the compensation for the pawn.}) 10. Nxc3 Nf6 11.
Qe2 {[%csl Rf6,Rf8,Rg7] Now White has some compensation as it is not super
easy for Black to develop the kingside.} Be6 12. O-O c6 {With this move, Black
defends the d5 square and tries to stay solid, but this is somewhat passive as
it allows White to bring in more pieces into fray. Furthermore, it will
transpire that this pawn can become a target and allow some hidden tactical
possibilities later in the game.} ({With that being said, it was not super
easy to find an alternative. If Black were to go for the natural kingside
development with} 12... g6 13. Qf3 {[%cal Yc1g5,Ye4e5] then this queen move,
threatening e5, is very strong. It is very hard for Black to find a reply, e.g.
} Rb8 (13... Nd7 {Doesn't work as White plays} 14. e5 {All the same!} Rc8 15.

compensation for the pawn. In fact, the engine thinks White is objectively
winning already.}) (13... Bg4 {Is the only move according to the computer, but

this position.}) 14. Bg5 Bg7 15. e5 {[%csl Rf6][%cal Gc3e4,Rg5e7] And with Ne4

White has won a piece.}) ({The best move, however, was} 12... b4 {Kicking the
knight from c3 away. The critical continuation now is} 13. e5 dxe5 14. Ne4 {
When White seems to have compensation for the two missing pawns, but not more
than that.}) 13. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5d8,Gc3d5] Bringing the bishop into the game and
creating some ideas of Bxf6 and Nd5.} (13. Re1 {and}) (13. Bf4 {were

weaknesses all over the place, providing White with sufficient compensation
for the pawn (although probably not more).}) 14. axb3 Qe6 $2 {But this is a

allows a nice combination we are about to see.} (14... h6 {was absolutely

understandably - decides to go for the pragmatic approach.} (17. Nxb5 {[%cal

next move etc. Maybe Smyslov was worried that after} Nb8 18. Nd4 Qg4 {He would

this in advance, so probably his choice was more pragmatic and prudent!}) 17...

this is way too slow.} (17... Nb8 {[%cal Rb8a6,Gb8c6] Trying to defend the c6
pawn and attack the rook on a6 is also a possible defensive try, but after} 18.

thing willingly.}) 19. Nd5 {Black is losing all the same.}) 18. Rxc6 $3 {

pieces into the attack with} 21. Rd8+ Kc7 22. Nxb5+ Kb7 {And here the nice
geometrical idea} 23. Qxc6+ {works in White's favour as after} Kxc6 24. Nd4+

capture the bishop and if the knight is captured then} fxe6 26. Be7 $18 {

{[#] Smyslov's career - just like careers of so many other chess players of
that era - was inevitably affected by the World War II, during which all
International Chess Competitions ceased (and during which the whole world was
sent on turmoil, obviously). --- In fact, many of Smyslov's chess playing
peers and even childhood friends, who weren't necessarily as strong as him,
were called to army and ended up losing their lives on the battlefront.
Fortunately, Smyslov was not one of them as he got a job in the aviation (I
believe, but don't quote me on it) and spend the war years working in an
office, away from the front. --- On the other hand, even though there weren't
any International tournaments at a time, the Soviet Chess Federation was keen
on not letting their players to get completely rusty and organized quite a few
tournaments during the War Years. --- It was during one of those
war-tournaments - the Moscow Championship 1943 - when Smyslov managed to
defeat the great Mikhail Botvinnik for the very first time. --- Let's join the
came on move 21. Even though he employed a very dubious variation of the Ruy
Lopez, after an unforced error on Smyslov's part, Botvinnik took over the
initiative. At this critical juncture, he has to decide on the course of
action - and it is precisely here where Botvinnik went wrong. Can you do
better than the Partiarch and suggest a convincing course of action?} 21... Ne2
{The simple jump of the knight to e2 was also quite unpleasant. It is a more
human option.} ({Black had two interesting options at the disposal. The first
one involved placing the queen on the nice active diagonal where she eyes g1.
This is important as after} 21... Qb6 $5 22. Nb3 Ne2 23. Nxe2 Rf1+ {[%csl Rg1]
[%cal Rb6g1] The fact that g1 is under control and Ng1 is not possible is
extremely annoying for White.}) (21... c5 $2 {This move - trying to set the
pawn chain into motion - is logical from the human viewpoint, but objectively
not the best as it is simply to slow to meet the demands of this complicated
position.}) 22. Nxe2 Rxe2 {Black is very active. Maybe Botvinnik wasn't sure
about what happens if the rook is kicked away say with} 23. Bd3 {but here
there is a strong option} Qe5 $1 24. Qxe5 Rxe5 {[%cal Re5e1,Rf8f1] And this
endgame is won for Black as White's pieces are not coming out anytime soon and
the rooks are too active on the open files.} 1-0

era - was inevitably affected by the World War II, during which all
International Chess Competitions ceased (and during which the whole world was
sent on turmoil, obviously). --- In fact, many of Smyslov's chess playing
peers and even childhood friends, who weren't necessarily as strong as him,
were called to army and ended up losing their lives on the battlefront.
Fortunately, Smyslov was not one of them as he got a job in the aviation (I
believe, but don't quote me on it) and spend the war years working in an
office, away from the front. --- On the other hand, even though there weren't
any International tournaments at a time, the Soviet Chess Federation was keen
on not letting their players to get completely rusty and organized quite a few
tournaments during the War Years. --- It was during one of those
war-tournaments - the Moscow Championship 1943 - when Smyslov managed to
defeat the great Mikhail Botvinnik for the very first time.} 1. e4 {As we said,
back in the day Smyslov used to play 1.e4 quite regularly.} e5 {But this was a
bit surprising move to see from Botvinnik, who was a great specialist in the
French defence, but also the Classical Sicilian and the Caro-Kann. Then again,
back in the day it was easier to be versatile in the opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 {I believe this is one of the rare instances
where Botvinnik played the Open variation of the Ruy Lopez.} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5
8. dxe5 Be6 9. c3 Bc5 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Bc2 {As mentioned earlier, I am not too
keen to talk about all the intricacies about the opening moves and their
subtleties at this point. If you want to check this particular line in greater
detail, I would definitely recommend the course The Grand Ruy Lopez by Nils
Grandelius on Chessable, as I know he covers the whole 9.c3 move order there
in some detail.} Nxf2 $5 {This sacrifice, leading to the so-called Dilworth
variation in the Ruy Lopez, is extremely popular nowadays (as it is very
direct and suitable for analysis with Modern computers). For example, it was
recently seen in the Candidates tournament in a game between Nakamura and
Caruana.} ({Other options include} 11... f5 {when} 12. Nb3 {should objectively
give White a good game.}) (11... Bf5 12. Nb3 {Is also a possible variation
where White should be able to gain some advantage.}) 12. Rxf2 f6 13. exf6 (13.

13... Qxf6 $6 {But this is not the most precise move order, allowing White an
additional option we will see on the next move.} (13... Bxf2+ 14. Kxf2 Qxf6 {
Is one of the main positions of this entire line. White has two pieces for a
rook and a pawn, but practice has shown that Black's practical chances
shouldn't be underestimated.}) 14. Qf1 $1 {This is a difference. Now White
manages to include the queen very harmoniously in the game and doesn't have to
lose time by going back to f2 and back with the king, which means that White
is comfortably better.} Bg4 {Trying to increase the pressure on the f3 knight,
but this is going into totally wrong direction.} (14... Bf5 {Is indicated by
the computer as the best move, trying to neutralize White's strong
light-squared bishop, although after} 15. Bxf5 Qxf5 16. Nb3 Bxf2+ 17. Qxf2 {
White once again has a very harmonious position in which Black's combative
resources are slowly running out.}) 15. Kh1 $2 {But this is a serious mistake
- an invaluable loss of time that can't be afforded in this position.} ({
White had several other possibilities but the dynamic move} 15. Qd3 {[%cal
Rc2h7,Rd3d5] Creating threats against both h7 and d5, was very strong here. It
is hard to suggest what Black should do know. Probably best is to take on f2
to get the king out, say} Bxf2+ (15... Qf5 {Going for the endgame doesn't
really inspire as after} 16. Qxf5 Bxf5 17. Bb3 Bxf2+ 18. Kxf2 $18 {[%csl Rd5]
White should have a decisive material advantage. Furthermore, Black's pawn
structure is not ideal (d4 and e5 are somewhat weakened, d5 is a target).}) 16.
Kxf2 Qh4+ 17. Kg1 $18 {And d5 is still hanging, White's pieces are
harmoniously placed and it is hard for Black to find the compensation for the
missing material.}) 15... Bxf2 16. Qxf2 Rae8 17. Qg3 Ne5 {Now suddenly things
are looking a bit tricky for White as all Black's pieces are participating in
the game while White is struggling with the development - and the king on h1
is also vulnerable to some back rank issues.} 18. Bd1 {[%csl Gf3][%cal Gd1f3]
It is understandable to want to reinforce the f3 point, but this is another
anti-developing move that places another piece on the back rank.} ({A move
like this one, trying to open up the rook or the bishop and get the pieces
into the game, was probably objectively the best (although it is definitely a
hard move for a human). Note that if Black tries to take on f3 it is not a
problem as after} 18. a4 Bxf3 19. Nxf3 Nxf3 20. gxf3 Qxf3+ 21. Qxf3 Rxf3 22.

complicated and somewhat unpleasant.}) 18... Nd3 {[%csl Gd3][%cal Ge8e1] This
is a logical move, trying to activate the knight further, but it transpires
that this is not the strongest option at Black's disposal!} (18... h5 {Trying
to create a diversion with the h-pawn was also possible. The idea is that
affter} 19. h4 Nd3 $13 {[%csl Rg4,Gh3][%cal Gh2h3] White doesn't have the same
h3 idea that was present in the game.} (19... Qd6 {might be even stronger
again, though!})) 19. h3 {Now White at least opens up the back rank with a
gain of tempo, although the situation remains very unpleasant.} Bh5 20. Bc2 Nf4
{[%cal Re8e2] Creating ideas of Ne2 or Re2.} 21. Ng1 {[%cal Gg1e2] White is
desperately trying to cover the e2 square.} (21. Bd1 {Is arguably better as now
} Ne2 22. Bxe2 Rxe2 23. Ng1 {Kinda works out for White, but who would want to
put the bishop on d1 again willingly?}) 21... c5 $2 {This move - trying to set
the pawn chain into motion - is logical from the human viewpoint, but
objectively not the best as it is simply to slow to meet the demands of this
complicated position.} ({Black had two interesting options at the disposal.
The first one involved placing the queen on the nice active diagonal where she
eyes g1. This is important as after} 21... Qb6 $5 22. Nb3 Ne2 23. Nxe2 Rf1+ {
[%csl Rg1][%cal Rb6g1] The fact that g1 is under control and Ng1 is not
possible is extremely annoying for White.}) (21... Ne2 {The simple jump of the
knight to e2 was also quite unpleasant as after} 22. Nxe2 Rxe2 {Black is very
active. Maybe Botvinnik wasn't sure about what happens if the rook is kicked
away say with} 23. Bd3 {but here there is a strong option} Qe5 $1 24. Qxe5 Rxe5
{[%cal Re5e1,Rf8f1] And this endgame is won for Black as White's pieces are
not coming out anytime soon and the rooks are too active on the open files.})
22. Ndf3 {[%csl Gf3][%cal Rc1f4,Rg3f4] A logical move, moving the knight away
from the path of the bishop, attacking f4 and also keeping it closer to the
king.} (22. Nb3 {However, it was probably better not to place the knight on f3
and avoid all ideas of Bxf3. Here if we continue in the same manner as in the
game then after} Ne2 23. Nxe2 Rxe2 24. Bd3 {Black doesn't have anything better
than to go for} Qe5 25. Qxe5 Rxe5 {But here with our knight already on b3 the
evaluation of the endgame is different as after} 26. Nxc5 Re1+ 27. Kh2 {
[%cal Ga2a4,Gc5b3] We have managed to get a pawn and get our pieces out and
can play Nb3-a4 next trying to get the rook in the game. The engine insists
this is still equal, but I feel only White can now play for the win.}) 22...
Ne2 $2 {But this now comes at the least appropriate moment, justifying White's
play perfectly!} ({Black could have exploited the fact the knight is now on f3
by capturing it with the bishop.} 22... Bxf3 {And now suddenly neither of the
captures is fully satisfactory for White, e.g.} 23. gxf3 (23. Nxf3 {Taking
with the knight looks very healthy and harmonious, but there is also a problem
in the view of} Nxg2 $1 {When Black has enough counterplay for equality.} 24.

they have two pawns and a rook for the two bishops and a lot of activity on
the open files.}) (23. Qxf3 {Taking with the queen is no good as it removes
the queen from controlling the e1 square and allows the unpleasant} Re1 24. Rb1
Ne2 25. Be3 {and here it seems White has it all covered but here comes the
unpleasant} Qe5 {[%cal Rf8f3,Re2g3] when White is in major trouble.}) 23... d4
{And this version of the endgame after} 24. Bxf4 Qxf4 25. Qxf4 Rxf4 26. Be4
dxc3 27. bxc3 Rd8 {Is also very unclear as White's pawn chain is very much
ruined. Probably the game should result in a draw.}) 23. Nxe2 Rxe2 24. Bd1 $1 {
Now this surprising bishop retreat, bolstering the f3 knight, is very strong
and justifies White's choice to move the knight to the kingside earlier in the
game.} (24. Bd3 {Going to d3 is not so powerful now as after} Bxf3 25. gxf3 Re6
{[%cal Rf6f3] The pawn on f3 is under attack and there is no time for some Bd2
move.}) 24... Re6 $6 {Not the most resillient, but in any case Black's
position is quite bad at this point.} (24... Bxf3 25. gxf3 Re6 {Was probably
more resistant as it at least ruined White's structure, but here since the
bishop is not on d3 and since the other bishop is protecting f3, there is not
much play for Black and White can continue calmly with} 26. Bd2 {[%cal Gf3f4,
Gd1f3] When the position should be technically winning after f3-Bf3 next.}) 25.
Bd2 {Now White has managed to fully consolidate and should be better due to
the slight material advantage.} h6 26. Kh2 Re4 $6 27. Ng5 $2 {[%cal Rd1h5]
Flashy, but not necessary. Virtually any other move like moving the rook or
the a-pawn would have kept a clear plus.} hxg5 $2 {Missing the final saving
chance.} (27... Bxd1 $1 {Black could have actually allowed White to take on e4
as after} 28. Nxe4 dxe4 29. Rxd1 Rd8 {[%cal Rd8d3,Rf6d6] It transpires there
is no easy way to get rid of the pin on the d-file. Black has ideas of Rd3-Qd6

evaluate, but objectively 27.Ng5? relinquished all White's advantage.}) 28.

{[%csl Re6] In the previous two encounters, we have seen how Smyslov had the
ability to play very violent, tactical, Tal-like chess - especially in his
youth (but not only in his youth). However, as a player, he is much more
famous for his positional, logical and "simple" style with the help of which
he sometimes outplayed his opponents imperceptibly and quietly. --- A perfect
example of "vintage" Smyslov style is the following game, played against the
Ukrainian Master Iosif Rudakovsky in the 1945 USSR Championship. It is a very
famous game that I use to this day to illustrate the power of occupying the d5
square in the Najdorf structure and it is a classic example of the "Good
Knight vs The Bad Bishop" scenario. --- The first critical position arose on
move 13. Black just moved the bishop to e6. Why exactly is this not the best
positional idea?} 13. f5 {[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5e6] A very strong continuation
that is very typical for this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6
and e5). White grabs space on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 where
it can potentially be exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver,
White does need to be careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5,
which is not the case here because this advance comes with the tempo on the
bishop on e6.} Bc4 $6 {[%csl Rc4] Continuing with the idea of exchanging the
bishops, but it is actually wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5
square. It is much easier for Black's bishop to control the d5 square than for
the bishop on e2, so this exchange is very much in White's favour.} (13... Bd7
{Retreating the bishop to d7 was objectively better, but now the e4 pawn is
not under the attack and White can once again play} 14. Bg5 Bc6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 {
And here White has a very good grip over the d5 square that can be increased
even further by bringing the pieces to the d-file and Black is much worse than
in lines with the immediate Bd7.}) 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 15. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5e7] A very
strong move! White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square and
intends to plant their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can do
against this plan, as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - the
bishop on e6.} Rfe8 {It is probably better to put the rook on another file as
on e8 it merely ends up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black's
position is strategically suspect.} 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Now we can see Black has no
pieces that can prevent the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and that
factor alone is already sufficient for the game to be strategically lost.} 17.
Nd5 {[%csl Ra8,Gd5,Re8][%cal Gd5c7] Furthermore - due to the positioning of
the rooks (a consequence of the move Re8) - White can jump to d5 immediately.}

{So, we have just seen how White managed to plant the knight on d5, which
almost immediately leads to a difficult position for Black. However, on the
next move, Rudakovsky made Smyslov's job even easier. Can you do better and
suggest the most resillient defensive move for Black in this position?} 17...
Qxc2 {For better or for worse, Black should have probably captured the pawn on
c2. At first glance it seems as if it loses an exchange - but at least it
disrupts the natural flow of the game - and forces White to give up the
wonderful knight on d5 (that is easily worth at least a rook). Play might
continue} (17... Bd8 {[%csl Gd8] A very passive defensive move, typical of
that era, that gives White everything they ever wanted in this position.}) 18.
Rf2 {[%cal Rf2a2] Attacking the queen and defending the b2 pawn.} Qc6 {The
queen has to stay on the c-file otherwise Nc7 happens all the same.} 19. Rc1 {
Winning the exchange nevertheless as Nc7 is unavoidable now.} Qa6 20. Nc7 {
[%cal Rc7e8,Rc7a8,Rc7a6]} Qxa2 21. Nxa8 Rxa8 22. Rfc2 {And even though White
has won an exchange, Black has two pawns for it and the conversion task is not
at all trivial. I think this would have been a much better saving chance and I
feel any modern player would go for something less clear and complicated
instead of a position where play is extremely one-sided.} 1-0

{Thus, we have previously seen how White managed to plant an unopposed knight
on d5. Now we are going to see how such a powerful steed can be use to decide
the outcome of the game in one's favour. In the diagram position, White
already has a very strong continuation at their disposal. How would you
continue here?} 22. f6 {Now finally Smyslov decides on this pawn advance,
opening up the kingside and creating a winning attack. It is possible to wait
and play some further preparatory moves, but this is a good moment to strike!
No matter how Black reacts, they are objectively completely lost.} gxf6 (22...
Bxf6 {Taking with the bishop is no better, as after} 23. Nxf6 gxf6 24. Qh4 {

[%cal Gd5d8] And here Rudakovsky finally decided to throw in the towel. A
convincing, superb and crystal clear game by Smyslov that is a model example
on winning the fight for the d5 square in these structures. I really like
these old games as their simplicity is sometimes extremely instructive. Mind
you, Rudakovsky wasn't some random slouch, but a very respectable master and
the game was played at the strongest competition of that time - the USSR
Championship - which just shows how much chess has evolved in the last 70
years on all fronts - especially in regard to the opening knowledge and in
terms of defensive play.} 1-0

king's pawn.} c5 2. Nf3 {But this is a bit surprising. Already back at that
time, Smyslov started playing the Closed Sicilian variation - an opening that
would bring him a lot of success throughout his career. But, that day he
decided to go for the more principled battle in the Open Sicilian.} e6 3. d4
cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {The pure Scheveningen variation is considered to
be a bit risky nowadays due to the possibility of advancing the g-pawn on the
next move, but of course, back in 1945 the theory of this variation (and of
many other openings) was only starting to develop.} 6. Be2 {This natural
developing move is a natural option - but not the most critical one according
to the 21st century standards.} (6. g4 $5 {This move, leading to the so-called
Keres attack, is nowadays considered to be by far the most critical test of
the Scheveningen variation.}) 6... Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 {Both sides develop
their forces in a logical and natural manner.} Nc6 {The main move in this
position, developing the knight, creating some pressure on the d4 knight and
anticipating the advance of the f-pawn that would allow Black to execute the
timely e5 counterpush in the center. Black is trying to make an argument in
this variation that moving the a-pawn is not necessary and that they can start
fighting for the center at once.} (8... a6 {Is another big move that
transposes to a version of the Scheveningen structure that can be reached via
the Najdorf move order (when Black plays a6 earlier on move 5). It was played
by a number of strong players, such as Carlsen, Anand and Ivanchuk.}) 9. f4 {
White, in turn, embarks on the standard plan for this structure, involving the
advance of the kingside pawns.} Qc7 {[%cal Gc7c6,Gc7e5] This move is somewhat
surprising, but actually not at all that bad. Black defends the knight on c6
and adds some more influence over the critical e5 square.} (9... e5 {Black

think this is a bit premature when the knight on c6 is not protected as after}

natural move in this position.}) 10. Qe1 {[%cal Ge1g3,Gg3h4] This move,
intending to transfer the queen to the kingside, is very standard for the
Scheveningen structure, but it is not so well-timed here as it allows Black to
execute the main idea of the e5 counteradvance.} (10. a4 {[%cal Gd1d4] Keeping
the option of recapturing on d4 with the queen and making a useful
semi-waiting move for now is a better option.}) (10. Kh1 {Is also a move that
comes into consideration.}) 10... Nxd4 {[%cal Ge6e5] A typical liberating
maneuver in the Sicilian, exchanging the knight and intending to strike in the
center with e5.} 11. Bxd4 e5 12. Be3 {Now Black has equallized comfortably as
they have gained their fair share in the center.} Be6 {[%cal Gf4f5,Ge6c4] But
almost immediately, Rudakovsky makes the wrong decision, allowing the pawn to

And White is in trouble as Black has a perfect control over the d5 square and

fianchetto the bishops, were both also sensible.}) (12... exf4 {Last but not

the possibility of ever playing f5 from White's array of options.} 13. Bxf4 Be6
{[%csl Rd6,Re4][%cal Gf6d7,Gd7e5] In this type of structure, the weakness of
the d6 pawn is counterbalanced by the weakness of the e4 pawn and the e5
square and usually in these structures, Black should be fine if they manage to
reach a position like this one without any major concessions.}) 13. f5 {
[%csl Re6][%cal Rf5e6] A very strong continuation that is very typical for
this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6 and e5). White grabs space
on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 where it can potentially be
exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver, White does need to be
careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5, which is not the
case here because this advance comes with the tempo on the bishop on e6.} Bc4
$6 {Continuing with the idea of exchanging the bishops, but it is actually
wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5 square. It is much easier for
Black's bishop to control the d5 square than for the bishop on e2, so this
exchange is very much in White's favour.} (13... Bd7 {Retreating the bishop to
d7 was objectively better, but now the e4 pawn is not under the attack and
White can once again play} 14. Bg5 Bc6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 {And here White has a
very good grip over the d5 square that can be increased even further by
bringing the pieces to the d-file and Black is much worse than in lines with
the immediate Bd7.}) 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 15. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5e7] A very strong move!
White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square and intends to plant
their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can do against this plan,
as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - the bishop on e6.} Rfe8 {
It is probably better to put the rook on another file as on e8 it merely ends
up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black's position is strategically
suspect.} 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Now we can see Black has no pieces that can prevent
the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and that factor alone is already
sufficient for the game to be strategically lost.} 17. Nd5 {[%csl Ra8,Gd5,Re8]
[%cal Gd5c7] Furthermore - due to the positioning of the rooks (a consequence
of the move Re8) - White can jump to d5 immediately.} Bd8 {[%csl Gd8] A very
passive defensive move, typical of that era, that gives White everything they
ever wanted in this position.} (17... Qxc2 {For better or for worse, Black
should have probably captured the pawn on c2. At irst glance it seems as if it
loses an exchange - but at least it disrupts the natural flow of the game -
and forces White to give up the wonderful knight on d5 (that is easily worth
at least a rook). Play might continue} 18. Rf2 {[%cal Rf2a2] Attacking the
queen and defending the b2 pawn.} Qc6 {The queen has to stay on the c-file
otherwise Nc7 happens all the same.} 19. Rc1 {Winning the exchange
nevertheless as Nc7 is unavoidable now.} Qa6 20. Nc7 {[%cal Rc7e8,Rc7a8,Rc7a6]}
Qxa2 21. Nxa8 Rxa8 22. Rfc2 {And even though White has won an exchange, Black
has two pawns for it and the conversion task is not at all trivial. I think
this would have been a much better saving chance and I feel any modern player
would go for something less clear and complicated instead of a position where
play is extremely one-sided.}) 18. c3 {[%csl Gc3,Gd5][%cal Gd5f6] Now White
secures the c-pawn and Black is left without any counterplay. The knight on d5
is a true octopus, influencing a large part of the board - most notably the f6

in these structures. I really like these old games as their simplicity is
sometimes extremely instructive. Mind you, Rudakovsky wasn't some random
slouch, but a very respectable master and the game was played at the strongest
competition of that time - the USSR Championship - which just shows how much
chess has evolved in the last 70 years on all fronts - especially in regard to
the opening knowledge and in terms of defensive play.} 1-0

{Even though there weren't any major International chess tournaments during
the World War II, in the war-torn USSR more than a few tournaments were
organized in the 1942-1945 period. Thus, Smyslov - as well as other Soviet
players - did get their regular practice and continued developing. --- It is,
therefore, not surprising that, after the war, Smyslov already turned out to
be one of the best chess players in the world. It already showed in the first
International tournament held in Groningen in 1946 where Smyslov came in third
behind Botvinnik and Euwe. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Smyslov was invited
to be one of the participants in the FIDE World Championship Tournament, held
in the Hague and Moscow in 1948. --- This tournament was supposed to resolve
the interregnum state that had arisen after Alekhine's death. Apart from
Botvinnik and Smyslov, Euwe, Keres and Reshevsky participated. It was
precisely the American grandmaster that Soviets feared the most as he was
considered to be Botvinnik's most serious competitor. --- Every encounter with
Reshevsky, was, thus, of utmost importance - but in round 11 of the tournament
Smyslov inflicted him a devastating blow. It is one of those brilliant
strategic/positional masterpieces Smyslov was rather known for and is
definitely one of his best games that fully deserves to be included on this
list. --- Let's join the game at the first critical moment - on move 13.
Reshevsky used the Steinitz Defence of the Ruy Lopez in this game, but didn't
handle the opening in very critical manner (not surprising, given that
Reshevsky was never a true opening specialist). Yet, in the diagram position,
there is a lot of tension in the center and it is not so easy to figure out
how best to handle it. How would you continue as White here? Can you find the
move Smyslov played?} 13. dxe5 $1 {For me, this is an oustanding move that
shows superb judgment. White deals with the threat to the e4 pawn and claims
that Black has no good way of recapturing on e5 for positional reasons.} Bxe5 {
It is hard to say which recapture is better. Or more precisely - worse. Taking
with the bishop seems crazy as it gets rid of the bishop pair, but Black is
claiming that the knights are better in this position due to its closed nature.
} (13... Ngxe5 {Taking with the knight would be met with} 14. Nxe5 {A very
strong idea, once again emphasizing the fact that Black doesn't have good way
of recapturing.} (14. Nd2 {[%cal Gf2f4] Even this knight retreat, preserving
the pieces and preparing f4, is possible.}) 14... Nxe5 (14... dxe5 {Always

this invites different kinds of problems.} (14... Ngxe5 15. f4 {Is still very
dangerous for Black.}) (14... Ncxe5 15. f4 {Leads to something very similar.})

attractive.}) 15. Qf3 {[%cal Rf3f7,Rb3f7] Threatening all sorts of discoveries
against f7. Black's problem are passive pieces - the knight is unable to jump
to f4 and the other one is severely restricted by the c3 pawn.} 1-0

{Let's join the game slightly later - on move 25. After a few transformations,
the position has become completely winning for White, as Black has a weak pawn
on d6 and White also has the bishop pair. However, things are never very easy
in chess - currently Black wants to play Nd7, remove the bishop from b6, then
slowly unravel with Rd8, Nc5 and so on. --- Smyslov, however, found a
wonderful way to transform the advantage and transition to a favourable
endgame. Can you find the set of maneuver he played in this very moment?} 25.
Bxe6 {[%csl Re6] As they say, one advantage of having the bishop pair is the
possibility of exchanging them at an opportune moment. This is a perfect
example - White gives up the light-squared bishop in order to ruin the
structure and force the advantageous transformation of the position.} fxe6 (
25... Qxe6 26. Qxe6 fxe6 27. Rxd6 {Leads to a completely lost endgame, of
course.}) 26. Qh4 {[%cal Rh4d8] A star move. When I first saw this positional
idea, I couldn't believe my eyes, as White is voluntarily inviting Black to
ruin the pawn structure, but in this position it is all about the activity in
the endgame.} Qd7 {Trying to keep the queens on the board and avoid the
depressing endgame, but this merely delays the inevitable.} (26... Qxh4 {
Taking the queen on h4 does ruin the structure, but after} 27. gxh4 Nd7 28.

double h-pawns. Besides, Black has a lot of weak pawns of their own and White
is just completely winning.}) 27. Qd8+ {Another strong point behind the Qh4
move.} Qxd8 28. Bxd8 {[%csl Rd6][%cal Rd1d6] Now it transpires it is not

many weaknesses.}) 29... Nc5 30. Rxd6 {[%cal Rd6e6] And this endgame should be
won as White has an extra pawn and the rook is very active. Although, of
course, it is never easy to win a chess game and some technique is still
required.} 1-0

{After some further adventures, on move 41, the following rook endgame has
been reached. Black has a passed pawn, but White has 4 vs 2 majority on the
kingside. Furthermore, Black's rook is in front of the a-pawn, while White's
rook on a7 is placed ideally behind the passed pawn. Due to all these factors,
White should be winning - but it is good to learn the winning technique in
similar endgames. --- Ideally, I would recommend you to try and win this
position against the computer. Alternatively, you can try to guess how Smyslov
continued here - although in this type of position it is not so much about the
moves as much as the concepts!} 41. g4 {White's general idea consists of

the opening phase of the game. But don't forget he was one of the strongest
players in the world for a loong time and that he would also have a rivarly

the opening phase of the game. But don't forget he was one of the strongest

{As we have previously seen, already in 1948, Smyslov was considered to be one
of the strongest players in the world and a legitimate contender for the World
Chess Championship title. And even though things didn't go his way in the very
next cycle (which was - somewhat surprisingly - won by David Bronstein) -
starting from the 1953-1954 World Championship Cycle Smyslov would dominate
the remainder of the 1950s and participate in no less than three World
Championship Matches against Mikhail Botvinnik. --- The crucial step toward
his first World Chess Championship match against Botvinnik was the legendary
Candidates Tournament 1953, played in Zürich. After 21 rounds, Smyslov was
tied with Reshevsky at 12.5/21, while the legendary Estonian Paul Keres was
just behind them with half a point less. --- It goes without saying that the
encounter between Keres and Smyslov in the 22nd round was of tremendous
competitive importance. We are now going to examine this historic game. The
first critical position arose on move 16. Smyslov didn't play the opening
perfectly and ended up in a suspicious position. How should have Keres
continued here?} 16. c5 {[%csl Gc3,Gc5][%cal Gc3c5] Advancing on the queenside

pointing it at the Black king. Even though Black has equalized, the position
is definitely not "dead" and a lot of play remains - which is probably what
White players employing such an unpretentious scheme are hoping for.} Nc6 {
[%csl Gc6][%cal Gc6b4,Gc6e7,Gc6a5] It feels a bit strange to place the knight
to c6 where it is blocking the bishop on b7, but it is far more active there
than on d7 and can jump, say, to b4 - or even reroute itself via e7 at some
point in the future. Also, if White ever plays a3, then Na5 comes into
consideration.} 10. O-O Bb7 11. Rc1 Rc8 12. Re1 {[%cal Gf3e5] Now we have
actually transposed to one of the main lines of the Colle system that was

though it was also played recently at the very high level.} (13... Re8 {
Calm move like Re8, bringing the rook to a file where it will be useful, is
very sensible, for example. White is the one who needs to find a way of
continuing next.}) 14. a3 {A nice intermediate move, kicking the knight from

{Thus, after winning the Zürich Candidates Tournament in 1953, Smyslov
qualified for the match against Botvinnik that was held in 1954 in Moscow.
This match turned out to be one of the most fighting and "bloodiest" in the
entire history of chess. Out of 24 games, 14 had a decisive outcome and at
some point there was a streak of 8- decisive games. --- Smyslov himself
started extremely poorly, losing 3 out of the first 4 games. However, after
winning game 7 and then scoring a hat trick in games 9-11, he took the lead
briefly before losing games 12 and 13 and finding himself trailing by a point
again. --- But then, in game 14, he managed to win again and level the scores
again. This is probably his most impressive creative achievement from that
first match and fully deserves to be mentioned here. --- Let's start our
explorations by examining the wild opening position that arose on move 14.

dubious, but it is not so easy to prove it. How would you continue as White
here? Can you find the best move?} 14. Be7 {[%cal Re7f8,Re7d6] From the modern

criticize the pioneers that trailblazed the path, but this is objectively not

resulting position. We will get back to this move in the next exercise.}) (14.

remain very complicated. Nevertheless, it seems that the practical results at
the grandmaster level favour White, which is probably one of the reasons why
these concrete line is not as popular nowadays.} 0-1

{[#] As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the
title by the narrowest of the margins. And even though by drawing the match he
proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the gruelling process of
qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates
tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam
Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
--- Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This
time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After
winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the
score in game 6 and then to seize a two point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
--- Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to
reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by
game 17 the tension had reached the peak. It is at this particular moment that
Smyslov played the following marvellous game that virtually clinched the match
in his favour. --- In contrast to the previous game, which was a tactical
masterpiece, this game was a pure positional/strategic battle. On move 19, we
have a position with symmetricla pawn structure, but where Black arguably has
a bit more potential to improve the position. Can you find the plan/concept
Smyslov utilized to improve his position in this exact moment?} 19... a5 {
[%cal Gb7a6,Ra6f1] Very good play. White's play in the center and on the
kingside is somewhat stuck, while Black improves the position on the queenside.

{In the game, Botvinnik decided to stay passive, but this allowed Smyslov to
obtain a decisive advantage with the help of a very thematic move. Which one?} 
45... g5 {[%csl Gg5] Now this move is very powerful as Black removes one
obstacle on the kingside and White also needs to lose a tempo to get the
knight back to c2 and initiate the whole idea with a4-b4 and so on - which
means that White is now objectively completely lost - in many pawn endgames,
the weakness of the e3 pawn and the potential advance of the f-pawn will be
decisive. --- I think we could stop for the purposes of this exercise as the
path toward victory is still lengthy. Still, it is very instructive to observe
how Smyslov goes about outmaneuvering Botivnnik and winning this position, so
I would definitely urge the dear student to check the full game - or even try
to win this position against the computer.} 0-1

{As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the
title by the narrowest of the margins. And even though by drawing the match he
proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the gruelling process of
qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates
tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam
Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
--- Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This
time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After
winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the
score in game 6 and then to seize a two point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
--- Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to
reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by
game 17 the tension had reached the peak. It is at this particular moment that
Smyslov played the following marvellous game that virtually clinched the match
in his favour.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. c4 c6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d4 O-O 6. Nc3 d5 7.
cxd5 cxd5 8. Ne5 {This time, instead of the King's Indian seen in the previous
game, we see a relatively quiet variation of the Fianchetto Grünfeld defence.}
b6 {[%cal Gc8b7] With this move Black intends to develop the bishop to b7, but
it is a little bit passive, although it is still played at the grandmaster
level to this day.} 9. Bg5 {I am not 100% sure I understand this move. The
idea is potentially to eliminate the knight on f6 that can sometimes jump to
e4, but I am not sure if that is the most dangerous idea of all time.
Furthermore, the bishop is exposed to Ne4 jumps on this particular square.} (9.
O-O {Is seen more often nowadays, when after} Bb7 10. Qa4 {or} (10. Bf4 {
Are both viable options.})) 9... Bb7 {[%csl Ge4][%cal Gf6e4] Continung with
the development of thee bishop and preparing to jump with the knight to e4.}
10. Bxf6 {The point of White's play. I guess the argument is that the knight
on f6 is very valuable here and that Black's dark-squared bishop doesn't have
that much scope, but still - White does give up the bishop pair voluntarily.}
Bxf6 11. O-O {I feel that after this move White doesn't have any advantage
whatsoever.} (11. f4 Bg7 12. h4 {This aggressive kingside expansion was seen
in a game between my two compatriots - Zdenko Kožul and Ivan Šarić - and it
seems it is more principled and dangerous way of posing some problems compared
to the timid kingside castling. That game continued} e6 13. h5 Nd7 14. hxg6
hxg6 15. e3 {When White had a small, but stable advantage, even though he
ultimately ended up losing the game.}) 11... e6 12. f4 {[%csl Gd4,Ge5,Gf4] A
standard plan of reinforcing the e5 knight and creating a dark-square bind in
these positions. But Black can play around this knight and in some very
distant future - White might regret that he weakened his kingside (as we will
see in the endgame in this game).} Bg7 13. Rc1 f6 {Expelling the knight from
e5 is possible, although not strictly necessary.} 14. Nf3 Nc6 15. e3 Qd7 16.
Qe2 Na5 {[%csl Gc4][%cal Ga5c4] A good move. The knight is eyeing the
potentially weakened c4 square.} 17. h4 {[%cal Gh4h5,Gg2h3] Also very typical
move, expanding on the kingside and preparing Bh3, trying to pressure the e6
pawn.} Nc4 18. Bh3 {[%cal Rh3e6]} Nd6 {[%csl Ge4][%cal Gd6e4] Now the knight
reroutes and also eyes the weak e4 square. Black shouldn't be worse here as
both sides have some weaknesses and weak squares, although a complex strategic
battle is in front of us.} 19. Kh2 a5 20. Rfe1 b5 {Very good play. White's
play in the center and on the kingside is somewhat stuck, while Black improves
the position on the queenside.} 21. Nd1 b4 22. Nf2 Ba6 {[%csl Ga5,Gb4][%cal
Ra6f1] The passive bishop is now activated and space advantage has been
secured on the left hand side of the board. It is very instructive to observe
how Smyslov quietly outplays his formidable opponent.} 23. Qd1 Rfc8 {The next
step is the occupation of the open file.} 24. Rxc8+ {This is a bit too
cooperative. As usual, exchanging on our opponent's ground helpes them more
than it helps us to relievee the tension.} (24. Rc5 {Hoping to double on the
c-file in the future was interesting.}) (24. e4 {Trying to imbalance play by
breaking through in the center was also a bit more combative than the text
move.}) 24... Rxc8 25. Bf1 {[%csl Gb5,Gc4,Ge4] Seeking further exchanges, but
it transpires that this one is also to Black's benefit as now the
light-squares are weakened.} Bxf1 26. Rxf1 Qc6 {[%cal Gc6c2] Intending to play
Qc2 and go for a nice endgame.} (26... Qb5 {Trying to maintain the tension by
keeping the queens on the board and trying to exploit some light-squares with,
say, Nf5 next, came into consideration too.}) (26... h5 {[%csl Gf5,Gg4]
Securing some more light-squares, was also interesting.}) 27. Nd3 Qc2+ {
This looks tempting, but the queen exchange actually relinquishes a
significant part of Black's advantage.} (27... h5 {Once again, maintaining the
tension with some sort of semi-waiting move was worth considering.}) 28. Qxc2
Rxc2+ 29. Rf2 {[%csl Gf2][%cal Gd3f2] This is the problem for Black. White
manages to deal with the infiltration of the rook to c2 and now Black almost
has either exchange or retreat, meaning that a large part of the advantage is
now gone.} Rxf2+ 30. Nxf2 Nc4 31. Nd1 {[%csl Gb2][%cal Gd1e3,Gd1b2] Now all
weaknesses are covered and without the heavy pieces on the board, it is hard
to make progress for Black. Still, the game is far from over and now we enter
a completely new stage of the game.} Kf7 32. b3 $2 {[%csl Rc3][%cal Rb3c4] But
this is a mistake. It is natural to want to kick the knight from the c4 square,
but in the process, White is weakening the c3 square.} ({It was better to try
and wait with a move such as} 32. Kg2 h5 33. Kf2 {And it is hard for White to
make further progress.}) 32... Nd6 33. Kg2 h5 {[%csl Gg4] Clamping down on the
light-squares! Black probably has to play this move sooner or later.} 34. Kh3 {
White tries to play g4 to eliminate some pawns, in return.} Ne4 35. g4 hxg4+ $2
{But this exchange also turns out to be a mistake as it changes the character
of the structure on the kingside. Smyslov probably thought White's h4 pawn
would be a weakness in the long-run, but it transpires that this is not
necessarily true.} (35... Bf8 {It was better to simply continue waiting and
improving the position as it is not entirely clear what White will do with the
g-pawn. Say if} 36. g5 (36. gxh5 gxh5 {[%cal Gf7g6,Gg6f5,Gf5e4,Gf5g4] Also
gives the Black king g6-f5 route.}) ({Not reacting to the tension with
something like} 36. Ne1 Bd6 37. Nd3 Bc7 {Puts White in some sort of zugzwang
as it gets more and more difficult to move the pieces, say} 38. Ne1 e5 {
With a decisive opening of the position.}) 36... Bd6 37. gxf6 Kxf6 {[%cal
Gf6f5,Gf5e4,Gf5g4] The king can now infiltrate with f5 and e4/g4 in the future.
}) 36. Kxg4 f5+ {I guess this was the point of Smyslov's idea. Now the d8-h4
diagonal is open and Black can potentially try to attack the h4 pawn (which is
what happens in the game). But it transpires that this is less strong than
what was considered in the previous note.} ({Going for the same plan of Bd6-e5
as in the previous note doesn't work for the simple reason that the king is
not tied to the defence of the g-pawn, so after} 36... Bf8 37. Ne1 Bd6 38. Nd3
Bc7 {White can simply move the king and not the knight on d3} 39. Kf3 {And it
is hard for Black to make progress here.}) 37. Kh3 Bf6 38. Ne1 Kg7 39. Nd3 {
[%csl Gd3] Now once again, White's pieces are doing a good job of defending
everything and it is hard to make progress. That is why Smyslov decides to
sharply alter the character of play and go for the transformation of the
position.} Nc3 $5 {Sharply changing the character of play at the verge of the
first time control (which usually happened on move 40). Smyslov invites the
exchange of the knight and transformation into a bishop vs. knight endgame and
seemingly there is no way for Botvinnik to refuse it!} ({If Black continues
waiting, White has several ways of maintaining the balance.} 39... Be7 40. N1b2
{This is the computer solution. White gives up the c3 square but creates
counterplay in an unexpected fashion, e.g.} (40. N3f2 {Is a more human way.
After} Nc3 41. a4 {White manages to remove the weakness on a2 and it is hard
for Black to make progress.}) 40... Nc3 41. Nc5 Nxa2 42. Nb7 {And White has
solved all the problems.}) 40. Nxc3 bxc3 {[%csl Rc3] So, let us stop for the
moment and ask ourselves - why exactly should Black pretend to be better in
this endgame? Well, the pawn on c3 is a temporary distraction for our opponent
and needs to be dealt with. The only way in which White can do so is going
with the king all the way to d3 and then capturing it. This, in turn should
allow Black to capture the h4 pawn (which is something h can do anyway,
actually) and run with king to f2, threatening to capture on e3. Furthermore,
Black can also push g5 and then f4 at the appropriate moment. Thus, White has
to defend accurately as Black has a clear plan of going forward.} 41. Ne1 {
Missing the immediate opportunity to resolve all problems!} (41. b4 {This
should lead to a draw, although lines are far from easy.} a4 {The more complex
try leading to a very complicated endgame.} (41... axb4 42. Nxb4 {White will
very likely collect the c3 pawn at the right moment and the passed a-pawn will
be a big enough nuisance to secure equality!}) 42. b5 {Is also sufficient as
Black has to deal with the b-pawn. Play might continue} Bd8 43. Kg3 Kh6 44. Kf2

will win in complications after} c2 49. Kxc2 Kxe3 50. Nc5 Ba5 51. Nxe6 {
The passed pawns on the queenside are too dangerous and the knight is perfect
on e6.}) 46. Kd1 Kxh4 47. Kc2 (47. Nc5 Kg3 48. Nxa4 Kf3 {Is different compared

a-pawn)} Bb6 55. Ka3 Ba7 56. Ka4 Bb6 {And neither side can make any progress
here and the game should end in a draw. A fascinating variation that
demonstrates the full complexity of this endgame.}) 41... Kh6 42. Nc2 {[%csl
Gc2,Rc3,Gd3] Maneuvering the knight to c2 is very sensible, though, as now the
pawn is blockaded and the d3 square vacated for the king.} Be7 {Now Black does
prevent the b-pawn from advancing before assaulting the h4 pawn.} 43. Kg3 {
Not yet losing, but it does demonstrate Botvinnik was not aware of the key
idea in this position (which will end up costing him later). He could have
advanced the a-pawn here at once.} (43. a4 {This would lead to a variation
very similar to the one we will examine in notes to White's 45th move.}) 43...

king.} 44. Kf3 (44. a4 {Was once again a bit more precise as it would have
forced Black to capture on h4 with the bishop. After} Bxh4+ 45. Kf3 Bd8 {
White has something similar to the variation that could arise in the notes to
the next move, but with the Black king still being on h5, which is maybe a
minor difference, but a difference nevertheless.}) 44... Kxh4 45. Ne1 $2 {

necessary to advance the a-pawn. As mentioned earlier, it would have allowed

And here Botvinnik finally resigned as the king will penetrate either to e2 or
to the queenside and White will end up in a similar zugzwang as in the
variation analyzed on move 66. A tremendous game and absolutely mesmerizing
endgame play by Smyslov - at such an important and crucial moment of the match.
--- After this game, Smyslov also won the 20th game and clinched the match
after 22 games with the score 12.5-9.5, becoming, thus, the 7th World Champion.
Alas, his reign would last only for one year as he would lose the title the
very next year in the 1958 rematch, although his career would continue for a
loong loong time after that.} 0-1

{[#] Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik,
Smyslov didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess
Championship title until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he
reached the final of the Candidates cycle before losing to the future World
Champion, Garry Kasparov. --- As this feat suggest, despite being the World
Champion only for a single year, Smyslov continued playing at the high level
and very succesfully throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic
style and arguably his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the
age factor (or by health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other
players and continued to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s.
--- Of course, it is very hard to make a selection of the best games played
over a 30+ year long period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best
games should include the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet
Team Cup held in Riga in 1968. --- Let's start our journey through it by
examining the position that arose on move 22. Smyslov has managed to
strategically outplay his opponent and now - a way to increase the advantage
is required. How would you continue in this exact position?} 22. f4 {[%csl Gf4]

best.} exf3 {[%csl Re3,Ge4,Gg4] Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3
square and provided the e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in this

pronounced simply because White has better placed pieces.} 23. Nxf3 {[%csl Rg5]

{Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik, Smyslov
didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess Championship title
until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he reached the final of the
Candidates cycle before losing to the future World Champion, Garry Kasparov.
--- As this feat suggest, despite being the World Champion only for a single
year, Smyslov continued playing at the high level and very succesfully
throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic style and arguably
his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the age factor (or by
health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other players and continued
to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s. --- Of course, it is
very hard to make a selection of the best games played over a 30+ year long
period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best games should include
the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet Team Cup held in Riga
in 1968.} 1. c4 {Not a surprising opening move by Smyslov. Especially in his
later years, he switched from 1.e4 to slower, closed systems with increasing
frequency.} e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Rb1 {Preparing the push of
the b-pawn is a standard plan in a number of positions where the pawn on c4 is
meeting the pawn on e5.} d6 6. b4 a6 {I am not sure if this move is required
as it helps White to open up things on the queenside with b5, although it was
played by some strong players so what do I even know.} 7. e3 f5 {I am also not
too sure about this aggressive setup with f5 in these positions - especially
with White having played e3 instead of d3, but once again, since I don't play
these positions with either colour my insight should be taken with a huge
grain of salt. --- Nevertheless, this is a very fresh position with only a
handful of games in the database.} 8. Nge2 Nf6 9. d3 O-O 10. O-O Bd7 11. a4 {
[%cal Gb4b5] White is very clearly preparing to go b5.} Rb8 {But this move
doesn't make sense to me at all. If you played a6 earlier, weren't you hoping
to open up the a-file for the rook once b5 happens? Why defend the pawn
modestly with the rook then and deviate from that plan?} (11... Qe7 {A normal
developing move seemed quite sensible. After} 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Nd8 {
Black defends b7 and has the a-file open, which is certainly better than what
happened in the game.}) 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Ne7 14. Ba3 {[%cal Ra3f8,Gb5b6]
An active place for the bishop in these positions, as it is fairly active on
this diagonal and eyeing the c5 square, preparing for the potential c5 push.
There is also the idea of playing b6 next.} Be6 15. Qb3 {I am not 100% sure
about this move as now c5 is not possible, although the computer doesn't
complain.} (15. c5 {Would be my expectation, although after} d5 16. c6 {
The situation is not completely clear.}) (15. Qc2 {I would also expect moving
the queen to a square where there is no pin would be more sensible but, then
again - what do I know. The engine thinks all these moves are roughly
equivalent.}) 15... b6 $6 {But this is apparently wrong. Black decides to
prevent c5 once at for all, but he is playing on the side of the board where
their opponent is attacking.} (15... Qd7 {A semi-waiting move like this one
was quite reasonable. Then after, say} 16. f4 Bf7 17. b6 c6 {The situation is
complicated, but Black is by no means THAT much worse.}) (15... Bf7 {It was
also possible to play this prophylactic move, intending now to meet} 16. f4 {
With} exf4 17. Nxf4 {When the bishop is not under the attack.}) 16. d4 {
Quite a good move, trying to react in the center. White also tries to exploit
the newly weakened c6 square? How exactly. Watch and see!} e4 {Black can't
afford the center to open given that all White pieces are very actively placed.
} 17. d5 {[%csl Gc6,Gd4,Re6][%cal Rd5e6,Ge2d4,Gd4c6,Ga3b2] A very nice
positional move, opening up the d4 square for the knight from where it can go
to e6 and c6. It is true that this move weakens the e5 and c5 squares, but we
have to lose some to gain some. Also, with this move we pretty much give up on
the c5 idea, but we are ready to reroute our bishop to b2.} Bf7 18. Nd4 Qd7 (

knight to c5 or e5 first, but as it is White keeps the edge and can even
consider undermining the structure with} 19. f3 (19. Ra1 {Also comes into the
consideration.})) 19. Bb2 {[%cal Rb2g7] The bishop retreats to the long
diagonal.} g5 {Trying to initiate some kingside play and gain some space on
that side of the board, but Black's pieces are not really ready for the
kingside initiative.} 20. Nce2 {White slowly improves the pieces. Note how
Smyslov doesn't hurry to jump with the d4 knight to either e6 or c6.} (20. Nc6

Rbe8 {It is somewhat out of the game.}) (20. Ne6 {This simply loses a pawn}

might be in danger on this square in the future.} ({A move such as} 20... Bh5 {
was probably better, trying to activate some pieces and potentially echange
this slumbering bishop for the knight on e2.}) 21. Ra1 Ng6 22. f4 {A very
powerful move, opening up the kingside to White's advantage and at the same
time preventing Balck from ever playing f4! White's pieces are all perfectly
placed so it is very natural that a pawn move is the best.} exf3 {[%csl Re3,
Ge4,Gg4] Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3 square and provided
the e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in this position where both
sides have some weak squares, Black's weaknesses are more pronounced simply
because White has better placed pieces.} 23. Rxf3 $6 {This is, actually, not
the most precise continuation.} (23. Nxf3 {[%csl Rg5][%cal Rf3g5,Rb2h8] Taking
with the knight, opening up the bishop and threatening the g5 pawn was
actually better. After, say} h6 (23... Ne4 24. Bxg7+ Kxg7 25. Nfd4 {[%cal

pronounced, e.g.} Bg8 26. g4 $1) 24. Nfd4 {[%cal Rd4f5,Rg2e4] The knight can
simply go back, attack the f5 pawn at the moment when the bishop is keeping
the e4 square under control.}) 23... Ne7 $2 {But this passive defence of the
f5 pawn is, well, simply too passive.} (23... Ne4 {The active jump with the
knight was to be prefered, although it does look as if Black is losing a pawn.
However after either} 24. Nxf5 ({Or} 24. Rxf5 Nc5 {Black suddenly has some

in both lines, but it is much more combative and murky than the game
continuation.}) 24... Ne5) 24. Nc6 {[%csl Gc6][%cal Ge2d4] Finally jumping to
a weak square and hoping to eliminate the important defender of the f5 pawn.
The other knight can always come to d4 and reinfroce the attack.} (24. Raf1 {

Nd4 {[%cal Gd4e6,Rd4f5] Black is in deep trouble.}) 25. Ned4 {[%csl Gc6,Gd4]
Now the other knight joins the fray and the threat to the f5 pawn is very real.

to confuse matters.} 26. cxd5 $2 {But this recapture is probably a bit
unecessary as it provides Black with reasonable counterplay all of a sudden.} (

position still remains complicated, of course.}) 26... Bxd5 27. Nxf5 $5 {
A very creative, Tal-like move, involving the sacrifice of the full queen,

idea is to uncover the attack on the g7 bishop and create play against the

sufficient though, although after} Bxf3 28. Bxf3 {The technical task of

better as it protects the e3 pawn and the bishop is more stable here. Despite

{[#] As mentioned earlier, despite being an ex-world champion already in 1958,
Smyslov continued to compete at the high level for decades. Arguably the
greatest achievement from his later years happened in the 1982-1985 cycle. ---
First, Smsylov qualified for the Candidates matches by winning the 2nd place
at the strong Interzonal in Las Palmas (at the time, 3 Interzonals were held
and two players from each Interzonal were seeded in the Candidates matches,
together with the finalists from the previous cycle). --- Then, in the
quarterfinal Candidates match, luck shined on him as he managed to eliminate
Robert Hübner (the regular match ended up 5-5, four tiebreak games also
didn't produce a winner which was, in the end, decided by a spin of the
roulette wheel!!). --- Then, in the semi-final Candidate match, Smyslov faced
the strong Hungarian grandmaster Zoltan Ribli. After the wins were exchanged
in the first two games and two subsequent games, the score in the match was
tied. Then, the fifth game happened where Smyslov produced the following
masterpiece. --- We join the action on move 16. Up to this moment, Ribli has
been outplaying Smyslov quite convincingly in the position with an isolated
queen pawn and obtained a very good, almost winning position. However, at this
crtiical moment, he underestimated the danger and made a big mistake. Can you
improve on his play and find a reasonable move for Black in this position?} 
16... Nf5 {[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5d4,Rd3h7] It was far better to move the knight
to f5 and prevent the queen from going to h7 so easily. If White wants to
insist on it, he has to go for} (16... Ng6 {Is also better than what Ribli did
in the game, although the knight is more active on f5, for sure.}) (16... Ba4
$2 {So far, Ribli has been playing an excellent game, but here he misjudges
the potential danger to his king and allows Smyslov to grab the initiative.})
17. g4 Nd6 {[%cal Gg8f8,Gf8e7] When now the knight is on d6 and not on e7 -
which means that the king has the e7 square available after, say} 18. Qh7+ Kf8
19. Ng3 Ke7 {[%csl Ge7,Rg4] This, in combination with the fact that the pawn
is now on g4, makes a whole lot of difference in the position. White doesn't
have an attack here and Black should be objectively winning (although the
position does remain to be difficult to play for both sides).} 1-0

{As mentioned earlier, despite being an ex-world champion already in 1958,
Smyslov continued to compete at the high level for decades. Arguably the
greatest achievement from his later years happened in the 1982-1985 cycle. ---
First, Smsylov qualified for the Candidates matches by winning the 2nd place
at the strong Interzonal in Las Palmas (at the time, 3 Interzonals were held
and two players from each Interzonal were seeded in the Candidates matches,
together with the finalists from the previous cycle). --- Then, in the
quarterfinal Candidates match, luck shined on him as he managed to eliminate
Robert Hübner (the regular match ended up 5-5, four tiebreak games also
didn't produce a winner which was, in the end, decided by a spin of the
roulette wheel!!). --- Then, in the semi-final Candidate match, Smyslov faced
the strong Hungarian grandmaster Zoltan Ribli. After the wins were exchanged
in the first two games and two subsequent games, the score in the match was
tied. Then, the fifth game happened where Smyslov produced the following
masterpiece.} 1. d4 {No more 1.e4 stuff that were prominent in Smyslov's youth.
Note that he was 62 years old at the time when this match was played!} Nf6 2.
Nf3 e6 3. c4 d5 4. Nc3 c5 {The Tarrasch defence was all the rage in those days
(remember that Kasparov used it in the very same cycle with great effect).
Nowadays, this move-order is seen quite frequently as well, but mainly because
Black immediately opts to go for the very provocative variation involving the
immediate recapture on d4.} 5. cxd5 Nxd5 {With this move order, Black opts to
go for the very-solid Semi-Tarrasch variation!} (5... exd5 {Would lead to the
pure Tarrasch variation where Black accepts the isolated pawn but claims that
the dynamic chances compensate for this strategic weakness. Nowadays this
variation is not seen that often at the very top level, although it is a
frequent guest at the club level.}) (5... cxd4 {At the very top level, this
forcing line is nowadays all the rage. After} 6. Qxd4 exd5 7. e4 {It was
discovered that the endgame arising after} dxe4 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Ng5 Be6 10.
Nxe6+ fxe6 {Is not at all so advantageous for White as it looks at the first
glance (better structure, pair of bishops).}) 6. e3 {Not the most ambitious
test of Black's opening scheme.} (6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 cxd4 8. cxd4 {Is another
big theoretical line these days.}) 6... Nc6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 cxd4
10. exd4 {So, by transposition we have reached a standard position where White
is the one with the isolated pawn on d4. Still, White has numerous attacking
ideas here so the weakness of the isolated pawn shouldn't be overemphasized.}
Bf6 {[%cal Rf6d4] Placing the bishop on a square where it is exerting pressure
on the d4 pawn and controlling the e5 square is quite logical - although not
the only way of handling the position.} 11. Qc2 {[%cal Rc2h7] With this move,
White tries to provoke a concession on the kingside as now the knight is
unable to go to f6 to defend the h7 pawn. Once again, there are other natural
moves in the position, but this idea seems quite reasonable.} h6 {Trying to go
without the weakening of the dark-squares, but this move allows White to try
to go for the more standard battery with the queen in front of the bishop (as
we will see happen in the game).} (11... g6 {Would weaken the dark-squares and
after} 12. Bh6 Bg7 13. Bxg7 Kxg7 {White can make an argument that the weakened
dark-squares make the Black king a little bit less secure!}) 12. Rd1 {Also
bringing the rook into play and indirectly defending the d4 pawn.} Qb6 {
[%csl Gc8][%cal Rb6d4,Rc6d4,Rf6d4] But this move is a bit too optimistic. The
queen tries to pressure the d4 pawn, but it is not particularly well-placed on
b6 and it is blocking the standard b6-Bb7 development.} (12... Re8 {Or
something similar, was more natural in this position.}) (12... Bd7 {Developing
the bishop at once and intending to maybe place it on c6, was also quite
natural.}) 13. Bc4 $6 {But this is not the most precise move. Smyslov tries to
pressure the d5 point and potentially exchange there and eliminate the
weakness, but it transpires Black has ways of dealing with that idea.} (13.
Bh7+ Kh8 14. Be4 {Was stronger. The idea is to keep the bishop on a more
active diagonal and also to displace the king. Now if} Nce7 15. h4 {[%cal
Gg2g4,Gg4g5] And suddenly g4-g5 is coming with a very great effect. Typical
computer stuff.} Bd7 16. g4 {[%cal Gg4g5] Here there is no good way to defend
against the unpleasant g5 somehow and White is doing very well.}) 13... Rd8 {
[%csl Gd5][%cal Gd8d5] Reinforcing the d5 point and intending to take on c3
next.} (13... Nce7 {Trying to reinforce the d5 point is also possible as now}
14. h4 Bd7 15. g4 {Isn't dangerous at all with the bishop exposed on c4 e.g.}
Nxc3 16. bxc3 Qc7 17. Bd3 Bc6 {And the few tempi that Black has gained make
all the difference in the world.}) (13... Nxc3 {Is a bit premature as after}
14. bxc3 Ne7 15. Bf4 Bd7 16. Ne5 {The bishop on d7 is not defended by the rook
which gives White one tempo. Not the most important tempo in the world, but it
makes a difference to a certain extent.}) 14. Ne2 {Trying to avoid the
exchange of the knight on c3, but it is clear this retreat is not the most
desirable move in this type of position.} ({In order to illustrate the point,
let's see what happens if White plays some natural move such as} 14. h3 Nxc3 {
Now this thematic exchange, going for the position with hanging pawns, makes a
lot of sense, as after} 15. bxc3 Ne7 16. Bf4 Bd7 17. Ne5 {The bishop on d7 is
defended and Black can continue harmoniously with} Rac8 {This might not look
like such a big deal, but now the bishop on c7 is under threat and Black has a
very harmonious position. In both cases the chances are approximately balanced,
but this small nuances are important for human players.}) 14... Bd7 15. Qe4 {
Smyslov intends to put the bishop on d3 and create some threats to the king,
although objectively speaking this shouldn't work - especially since White
lost some time moving the queen and the bishop back and forth.} Nce7 16. Bd3 {
[%cal Gd3h7] Threatening to infiltrate with the queen on h7.} Ba4 $2 {So far,
Ribli has been playing an excellent game, but here he misjudges the potential
danger to his king and allows Smyslov to grab the initiative.} (16... Nf5 {
[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5d4,Rd3h7] It was far better to move the knight to f5 and
prevent the queen from going to h7 so easily. If White wants to insist on it,
he has to go for} 17. g4 Nd6 {When now the knight is on d6 and not on e7 -
which means that the king has the e7 square available after, say} 18. Qh7+ Kf8
19. Ng3 Ke7 {This, in combination with the fact that the pawn is now on g4,
makes a whole lot of difference in the position. White doesn't have an attack
here and Black should be objectively winning (although the position does
remain to be difficult to play for both sides).}) 17. Qh7+ Kf8 18. Re1 Bb5 {
[%cal Rb5e2] Trying to exchange the light-squared bishop is quite sensible as
it gets rid of an important attacking piece.} (18... Rac8 {Ignoring the danger
and continuing the play is now too risky as after} 19. Ng3 {Nh5 is now a very
serious threat, e.g.} Bxd4 20. Nh5 Ng8 {And here White has the amazing} 21. Re5
{When g7 will fall and when Black's monarch is in real danger. This is, of
course, a cooperative variation, but one that illustrates the potential
dangers to the Black king.}) 19. Bxb5 (19. Be4 {Trying to keep the bishop is
sensible, but it allows} Bxe2 {This knight is also an important attacker and
with it gone, White's attack is gone as well. Thus Smyslov correctly keeps
this knight and allows the exchange of the bishop.}) 19... Qxb5 20. Ng3 {
[%cal Gg3h5,Gf3e5] One knight is heading to h5 and the other to e5. Black
should still have defensive resources here, but it is not too easy to handle
this in a practical game.} (20. a4 {[%cal Ga1a3,Ga3h3] With the idea of
including the rook into the attack, was also quite interesting.}) 20... Ng6 {
[%cal Gg6h8] Black takes a moment to open up the e7 square for the king and to
cover the annoying check on h8, although it is debatable whether this was yet
necessary. Still, sooner or later this knight will go to g6, so there is not
that much harm in doing it at this point.} 21. Ne5 {[%cal Re5g6] Bringing the
knight into the attack is very sensible.} (21. b3 {IS also a very interesting
move here. The idea is to play a4-Ba3 next. Say after} Rac8 22. a4 Qxb3 23. Nh5
{White also has some options of Ba3 at the right moment and the position looks
quite dangerous for Black. The engine suggests the best way is to give up the
exchange with} Rxc1 {Eliminating the strong dark-squared bishop.} 24. Rexc1 Qd3
{[%cal Gd3f5] And White has an extra exchange, but Black is very solid and
White's queen is somewhat stuck on h7, so the position is relatively unclear 
(although if anyone should have the upper hand it is White).}) 21... Nde7 $4 {
At the critical moment, Ribli goes full passive mode and underestimated the
dynamic possibilities available at White in this position.} ({First of all,
let us establish that captures on e5 don't work. Taking with the bishop is bad
as after} 21... Bxe5 22. dxe5 {[%cal Gg3h5] Nh5 comes and Black can't defend
g7.}) (21... Nxe5 {Is no better as after} 22. dxe5 {The bishop doesn't have a
good square.} Bg5 (22... Bh4 23. Bxh6) (22... Be7 23. Qh8#) 23. Bxg5 hxg5 24.
Ne4 {And White has a winning position here as Black's kingside is collapsing.})
(21... Qa5 {[%csl Re1][%cal Ra5e1] It transpires that attacking the rook,
bringing the queen to c7 and completely ignoring the knight on e5 (and the
threat on g6) was the best (and virtually the only) defence. After} 22. b4 Qc7
23. Nxg6+ (23. Be3 {Might be better, but once again, it is unclear how much of
advantage White has in this position.}) 23... fxg6 24. Qxg6 Bxd4 {Black's
point is that provoking b4 has allowed them to gain a tempo and that their
position is perfectly fine in this instance. This would have definitely been
better than the text move, although such a defensive move is extremely
difficult to find (unless you are an engine).}) 22. Bxh6 $3 {Boom. Now Black's
position collapses at once!} Nxe5 (22... gxh6 23. Qxf7#) (22... Bxe5 23. Rxe5
Nxe5 24. Qxg7+ {is not an improvement for Black.}) 23. Nh5 {[%cal Rh5g7,Rh6g7,
Rh7g7] The pressure against the g7 point is at its peak!} (23. dxe5 {Is also
good enough, as after} Bxe5 24. Nh5 Nf5 25. Bg5 {Black has to give up some
material or get mated!} f6 26. g4 $18) 23... Nf3+ {A possible defence, trying
to eliminate the option of advancing the g-pawn, but it doesn't change much.} (
23... Nf5 24. dxe5 Bxe5 25. Bg5 {Transposes to the line analyzed earlier.}) 24.
gxf3 Nf5 25. Nxf6 Nxh6 26. d5 {[%cal Re1e8] A wonderful move, creating
pressure against the e6 pawn and also creating various tactical ideas
associated with the capture on e6 and with the d6 discoveries.} (26. Qh8+ $4 {
Would be horrible as after} Ke7 27. Qxg7 {And suddenly White is the one losing
after} Rg8 28. Nxg8+ Rxg8 {[%cal Rg8g1] it is never too late to lose a game of
chess, I guess!}) 26... Qxb2 {[%cal Rb2f6] This loses by force - but what else
should Black play? Black at least tries to disturb the knight on f6, but now
Smyslov finds a very nice combination.} (26... Rac8 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Qxg7 {
is now winning for White as after} Rg8 29. Rxe6+ {Wins on the spot. This was
the point behind including the d5 move in the mix!}) (26... Ke7 {loses in a
very similar fashion:} 27. Qxg7 Rg8 28. Rxe6+) 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Rxe6+ $3 {
[%cal Re6e7,Rh8g7] A tremendous blow, opening up the 7th rank with a decisive
effect.} fxe6 29. Qxg7+ {[%csl Rb2][%cal Rg7b2] Now you can see some
discoveries are lining up against the queen on b2.} Nf7 {What else?} (29... Kd6
30. Ne4+ {Loses the queen on the spot.}) 30. d6+ {[%cal Gf6d5,Rd6e7] The crux
of the combination. White frees the d5 square for the knight in order to
deliver the fatal discovered attack on the queen on b2!} ({Only not} 30. Ng8+

towel. A wonderful creative achievement, sort of a swanson of Smyslov's career
- even if the opening was very suspect from the modern day standards. After
this game, Smyslov took 1-point lead and then went on to win game 7, as well
as the match, qualifying for the final Candidates match against Garry Kasparov.
--- A virtually unparalleled achievement at a such stage in the history of
chess - perhaps only Viktor Korchnoi achieved the same success in the World
Championship Cycle at an advanced age (although not even Korchnoi played the
Candidates Final match above the age of 60).} 1-0

[%csl Rf6,Rg7,Rh6] Is actually just winning for White due to the dark-square
weaknesses around the Black king.}) 20. Qe3 Bxc3 21. Qxc3 e3+ {And now Qe5 is
coming next and Black is actually winning. An amazing combination!}) 17. g4

the knight would have otherwise been lost!} 18. Kxf2 e4 {[%csl Rh2][%cal Rc7h2,

messy.}) 19... Be6 {[%cal Re6d5,Rg7a1,Rd8d1] A very unpleasant quiet move,
keeping the threat to the rook on a1 alive but also removing the bishop from
the attack and attacking the pinned bishop.} 20. Nd2 {Now it seems as if White
manages to lose only an exchange - not a full rook, but Smyslov has evaluated
correctly that the simple capture on d5 is sufficient!} Bxd5 {Actually - this
is the only move to win.} 21. cxd5 Rxd5 {[%cal Ra8d8,Rg7a1,Rd8d1] White is
completely tied up as the pin is deadly and also the rook on a1 is hanging.}

and a pawn, which is nominally not THAT bad, but the weakness of the king and
the activity of Black's rooks don't leave much room for hope.} (23... Rad8 {
It was actually possible to attack the knight on d2 here. The point is that
