1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 $5 {[pgndiagram] The Scotch! This opening made it's
debut on the modern chess scene when Garry Kasparov used it in 1990 match
against Karpov (and scored 1.5/2). Magnus Carlsen also played it on occasion,
while So used it only twice in his life (last time to beat Aronian in 2015
Tata Steel Tournament).} exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 {
[pgndiagram] The starting point of the so called Mieses variation of the
Scotch defence. Here So is the first to deviate from main theoretical paths} 8.
Nd2 {Transposing back to the 8 c4 Nb6 variation. So repeats his game against
Aronian. I remember watching Peter Svidler playing blitz on internet and
saying that this is certainly not the most challenging for Black, but it can
be tricky to handle over the board. In his annotations to the Aronian game So
says the same: "Maybe White has nothing here as well but I thought it's a
better try than 9 c4"} (8. c4 {Is the mainline and by far the most popular move
}) 8... a5 $5 {[pgndiagram] And Mamedyarov is the one to surprise So instead.
This move anticipates the future b3 by White and introduces possibilites of
Ba6, which must have crossed So's mind} (8... Rb8 {Was Aronian's choice}) (8...
g6 {Is the main move}) 9. c4 {Natural and probably the best} (9. Nf3 {A
logical continuaion of knight development leads to problems} Qb4+ 10. Nd2 Ba6 {
Is awkward for White}) 9... Nb6 {Transposing back to the 8 c4 Nb6 variation.

think White should have refrained from this move, since it only justifies the
early a5 more} (10. Qe4 {The typical Scotch move is probably OK for White} d5

His queen is annoying, White's queenside is weak and he is still not fully
developed} 14. Qd1 {The best, opening the path for the bishop on f1} Bb4 15.

think of.} (16. Bd4 {Is quite human, trying o place the bishop on e3. But the
problem is that it hangs the e5 pawn} Bc3 17. Be3 Qxe5 18. O-O O-O {And

a1 and defending the h7 indirectly} (18... g6 19. h4 {Is not that clear}) 19.

pieces still on} (22. gxf3 {There is no reason for White to spoil his pawn

sense} f5 26. Qe2 e4+ 27. Kg2 Ra8 {And Black has gained time to put his rook
on the open file compared to the variation before} 28. Bd4 Qxd4 29. Rd1 c5 {IS

position} 29. Bc3 $1 {Wesley keeps making some good moves} (29. Kf1 {Is such a
natural move} e4 {But here it is already hard to say what White should play.

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nh4 Bg6 {[pgndiagram] This
is a theoretical position. Black gives up his bishop pair in order to have a
fluid development. Topalov must be very familiar with this line since he
played it back in the 2006 World Championship match} 7. Nxg6 {The most common
move. White can't delay this move for many moves anyway} (7. Qb3 {Has also
been played} Qc7 8. h3 Nbd7 9. Nxg6 (9. Be2 {Is not ideal} dxc4 10. Bxc4 Bh5

the last Candidates tournament}) (8. Bd2 {Is the mainline here}) 8... c5 $5 {
And with this move we are already approaching some very rare waters. Topalov
surely takes some risk, as he will be left with an isolated pawn} (8... dxc4 {
Is a typical reaction to development of the light squared bishop} 9. Bxc4 Nbd7
10. h3 Qc7 11. Bd2 {With minimal advantage for White}) 9. Qb3 $5 {[pgndiagram]
The good move order} (9. cxd5 {Would allow extra option for Black} Nxd5 10. Qb3

much worse} 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 (11... exd5 12. dxc5 Bxc5 13. O-O {Favours White})

against isolated pawn} 13. Rc1 $6 {I don't like this move, allowing the
immediate d4} (13. Ne2 d4 14. e4) 13... Rd8 (13... d4 14. Ne4 dxe3 {And White

the opening phase of the game} d4 $2 {I think that this is premature} (16... g5

position} 17. Rc2 Kf8 18. O-O Ng4 19. h3 Nge5 {And White is only slightly
better}) 17. Bb5 $2 {Returning the favour} (17. e4 {Was very strong} O-O (17...

nowadays.} (9... Nc5 {Also has relatively healthy reputation}) 10. b3 a6 {I

1. e4 {[pgndiagram] Recently, Kramnik has played this move quite often. I
think it has something to do with the reappearance of the Italian game on the
highest level.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 $5 {But for me this is a surprise. He
opts for the Ruy Lopez instead.} a6 {And another suprise. No Berlin today} 4.
Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 $5 {[pgndiagram] This solid move, in the spirit of
the Anti-Berlin, has become very popular recently as a way of sidestepping the
well-trodden Spanish paths in other variations} (6. Re1 {Was more common in
the past}) 6... b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. a3 {[pgndiagram] We saw very similar ideas
with the slightly different move orders in the Carlsen - Karjakin match, where
Magnus was quite successful with the Black pieces} O-O 9. Nc3 {So far
everything everything was seen before, on the highest level as well} (9. h3 Bb7
10. Re1 {Would transpose to the Carlsen - Karjakin, game three}) 9... Nb8 $5 {
This Breyer like maneovre was played here before} (9... Na5 {Was Carlsen's
choice} 10. Ba2 Be6 {Was the game Topalov - Magnus, Paris rapid 2016}) (9...
Bb7 {Was Inarikev - Bu Xiangzhi, Chinese Team Championship, 2015}) 10. Ne2 Nbd7
11. c3 $5 {[pgndiagram] Only this is the first novelty of the game} (11. Ng3 {
Was seen in both Onischuk - Inarkiev, Wch rapid Berlin 2015, and Fressinet -
Sargissian, China Elite Mind Blitz, 2016. Both game ended in a draw}) 11... Bb7
(11... c5 $5 {Immediately is the alternative} 12. Ng3 Nb6 $1 {The point. Black
wants to play c4 before developing the queenside pieces} 13. d4 Qc7 14. Re1 Re8
{And a typical Spanish position arises in which Black should have his fair
share of chances}) 12. Ng3 c5 13. Re1 Rc8 (13... Nb6 {Was still worth
considering} 14. Nf5 Bc8 (14... c4 15. Bc2 cxd3 16. Bxd3 {Is slightly better
for White}) 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7 16. h3 {With slightly more pleasant position for
White. But who would move the bishop back to c8 again}) (13... Re8 {Is met by}
14. Ng5 Rf8 15. Nf5) 14. Nf5 $6 {[pgndiagram] Slightly premature maybe} (14.
Bc2) 14... c4 $1 {Now this is a good move, because the c5 square is available
for the knight} 15. dxc4 $1 {The best reaction} (15. Bc2 cxd3 16. Bxd3 Nc5 17.
Bg5 h6 18. Bxf6 Bxf6 19. Bc2 {And Black is not worse}) 15... Bxe4 16. Nxe7+
Qxe7 17. cxb5 axb5 {[pgndiagram] The exchange of the central e pawn for the
wing b pawn should be considered satisfactory for Black.} 18. Bg5 Nc5 19. Ba2 {
Instisting on keeping the position complicated} (19. Bc2 {Is safer} Bxc2 20.
Qxc2 h6 21. Bxf6 Qxf6 22. Rad1 {And the position is slightly better for White})
19... h6 20. Bh4 $6 {Playing with fire, as the bishop will be sidelined on g3}
(20. Bxf6 {Is better} Qxf6 21. Bd5 Bxd5 22. Qxd5 Rfe8 {But I doubt I would be
analyzing this game had this continuation been played}) 20... g5 21. Bg3 Bh7
22. Qe2 Kg7 23. Rad1 {[pgndiagram] Already planing the rook sacrifice on e5,
because else White's bishops remains out of play} Nfe4 24. Rd5 $5 {Here we go.
I don't know which annotation mark to assign to this move. Objectively it is
dubious, but it deserves at least one exclamation mark for creativity and
bravery} (24. h3 {Would be meek} f5 25. Bh2 f4 {And this is a dream position
for Black. White plays without the bishop for the remainder of the game}) 24...
f5 25. Rxe5 $5 {[pgndiagram] One of the most amazing moves of the year so far.
Kramnik coldly gives up his rook for two pawns} (25. Rxd6 {Was possibly a
better version} Nxd6 26. Bxe5+ Rf6 27. Qd1 {And here White might have more
compensation than in the game}) 25... dxe5 26. Bxe5+ Nf6 {Let's see what has
White gained in return. Both his bishops are actively placed, Black's b pawn
is under threat and his pieces are more active. But still, rook is a rook} (
26... Kg6 {Is possibly stronger. It is hard to find compensation for White} 27.
Bd4 Bg8 28. Bxg8 Rxg8) 27. Qxb5 {Now at least White grabs a pawn and his
queenside pawns might become dangerous once they start moving} Nce4 28. Bd4
Rfd8 {[pgndiagram] Harikrishna plays good for the moment} (28... Bg8 {Is met
tacticaly by} 29. Qxf5 Bxa2 30. Rxe4 Qf7 31. Re3 {And with four pawns for the
rook, and impeding Ne5, White's compensation is now serious}) 29. h3 $5 {This
is to me quite amazing. After giving up a rook, White plays a calm and slow
move. This is reminiscent of Kasparov, as such defensive moves in attacking
positions were one of his strongest traits.} Rb8 30. Qe2 Bg8 31. Bb1 {Now the
queenside pawns will starts advancing. Black actually has to be really precise}
Qb7 $1 {Harikrishna plays like a computer. He provokes the advance and
positions his queen on a commanding place on the queenside} 32. b4 Re8 33. c4
$5 {Not fearing the discovered attack} Qc6 $2 {[pgndiagram] Amazingly, this is
a serious slip} (33... Nd6 {Attacking c4, looked strong to my human eye, BUT...
} 34. Bxf6+ Kxf6 35. Qb2+ Kg6 36. Ne5+ Kh7 37. c5 {And once again Black has to
be very precise} Ne4 $1 {Everything else loses. Now White can continue the
game, or force a draw with} 38. c6 Qg7 39. Rxe4 fxe4 40. Bxe4+ Kh8 41. Ng6+ Kh7
42. Ne7+ {And things end in perpetual check}) (33... Qa6 {Was the strongest
move in the position, although Black is balancing on the edge and every wrong
step might prove fatal in the future.} 34. Qb2 Bxc4 35. Ne5 Kh7 36. f3 Nd6 37.
Rc1 Rbd8 {And White's compensation is running out of steam}) 34. Qb2 $1 {
[pgndiagram] It is amazing, but after this move White is out of the danger zone
} Rbd8 (34... Bxc4 {Is now bad} 35. Ne5 Qb5 (35... Qe6 36. Bxe4 fxe4 37. Ng4)
36. Bxe4 Nxe4 37. Nxc4+ Kh7 38. Ne3) (34... Kh7 {Removing the pin, was
important} 35. Rc1 Qe6 36. c5 Nh5 {And the position is complex, but White's
pawn phalanx is very dangerous. I don't want to give the evaluation because I
may well make a serious missjudgement}) 35. c5 Qe6 36. b5 {[pgndiagram] Pawns
just keep going. Please note that White is still a full rook down} Kf8 $2 {the
final blunder, after which it is all over} (36... Qb3 {Was the last chance} 37.
Qa1 Kg6 (37... Qxb5 {Is bad due to} 38. Bxe4 fxe4 39. Bxf6+) 38. Bxf6 Nxf6 39.
Rxe8 Rxe8 40. Bxf5+ Kg7 41. Nd4 Qc4 42. c6 {[pgndiagram] And I find it hard to
believe that Black can't hold the balance somehow here, but I am certain that
White isn't worse. His pieces are just wonderfully coordinated}) 37. c6 {Now
the pawns are too fast} g4 {Desperation} (37... Qb3 {Is too late now} 38. Bxf6
Qxb2 39. Bxb2 {And there is no stopping of the pawns}) 38. hxg4 fxg4 39. Bxe4
gxf3 40. Bxf6 Rd6 41. Bg7+ Kf7 42. Be5 {[pgndiagram] And now, being exchange
and three pawns down, Black decided he has had enough. A wonderful game by
Kramnik, who was rewarded for taking the risk like Tal in his best days.} 1-0

avoid the Nimzo-Indian these days} b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. Nc3 Ne4 $5 {The
main move in the position} (6... O-O {Loses control over e4 and leads to
different pawn structure, since Black is forced to go d5} 7. Qc2 d5 {The most
logical} (7... Na6 {Is inferior} 8. e4 d5 9. cxd5 exd5 10. e5 {With advantage
to White}) 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Nxd5) 7. Bd2 {Slightly counterintuitive, but this

win control over e4} Nxc3 8. Qxc3 O-O 9. O-O c5 10. Rd1 d6 {And Black is
pretty solid}) 7... Bf6 {Also very old, stemming back to 1974 Karpov -

(7... Nxc3 {Also justifies White's idea} 8. Bxc3 O-O 9. d5 $1 {[pgndiagram]
This is the difference. With the queen on d1, White can push d5 and choke the
bishop on b7}) (7... O-O {Leads to another line} 8. O-O d5 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Rc1
{And I am not familiar with the evaluation of the opening theory here, but I
guess that White has a slight advantage. Certainly both seventh moves are
playable}) 8. Qc2 {[pgndiagram] Relatively rare move, although Topalov has
already played it against Grischuk.} (8. O-O {Was Kortschnoj's choice in the
23rd game of that match.}) (8. Rc1 {Leads to complications that aren't

understand why White delays castling that much and moves his queen instead.

as there is no e3} 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5) (12. O-O {Seems flexible

concrete variation, or more on general grounds, in accordion with the "Don't
