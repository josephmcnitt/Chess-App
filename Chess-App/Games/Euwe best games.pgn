the height of the fashion} Bb6 $5 {[pgndiagram] A very rare move, pre-empting
the d4-stroke} (4... Nf6 {Is by far the main move}) 5. d4 Qe7 $6 {And this is

developing the knight} (9. a4 a5 10. Na3 {And at least White has won the b5

unpleasant sacrifice} (22. Bf1 {Was objectively wiser and White is still much
better}) 22... Nf4+ $3 {[pgndiagram] An excellent shot, creating big problems
for the opponent} 23. gxf4 $2 {And, as usual, the acceptance of the sacrifice
is faulty} (23. Bxf4 {Was better} Bh3+ (23... Nd6 {Is amazing computer move

But the alternative was also gloomy} (24. Kg1 gxf4 {Is now very unpleasant;
probably even won for Black. White doesn't have time to preserve the bishop -
the queen is coming to h7} 25. Bd2 (25. Nh2 {Is the only chance, but is also

why give up a piece?} Rxh2 30. Re2 Nd6 31. Bd3 {And it is not that hard to
find correct winning method for Black} Kf7 $1 {[pgndiagram] The idea is to
defend the bishop with Rg8} 32. Rg1 Rg8 33. Qd4 Rg5 {And Black should be able
to unravel slowly}) 29... Rxe4+ $3 {[pgndiagram] Very pretty conclusion to the

give a check}) 33. Kd3 Qxc4+ 34. Kc2 Bxf3 {And now BLack is technically winning
} 35. b3 Be4+ 36. Kb2 Qd3 37. Rg1+ Kf7 38. Rac1 $2 {[pgndiagram] But this
mistake lets Black end the game immediately} (38. Rgc1 {Was necessary, when
game still continues}) 38... Qd2+ 39. Ka3 Nc4+ $3 {A very nice finishing
combination} 40. bxc4 Rxa4+ 41. Kxa4 Qa2+ 42. Kb4 Qb2+ {[pgndiagram] And White
loses his queen after Kc5 Qxf2, so he resigned. A rather uneven game,
demonstrating the poor state of opening play and theory at those time, but
also Euwe's amazing tactical aptitude and creativity.} 0-1

Variation, the most aggresive variation against the Nimzo-Indian defence, was
at the height of popularity during the Zürich Candidates tournament} b6 $5 {A
rather rare variation} (6... O-O 7. Bd3 Nc6 8. Ne2 d6 {Was, and is, more common
}) 7. Bd3 Bb7 {The downside of this move is that Black usually plays Ba6 at
one point or another (pressuring c4) and here he loses a tempo for that} 8. f3
{[pgndiagram] The subtlety of the move order. White now has to spend a tempo
on f3, preparing e4} (8. Nf3 {Is playable though} O-O 9. O-O d6 10. Nd2 {When
e4 follows all the same}) 8... Nc6 9. Ne2 O-O 10. O-O Na5 11. e4 Ne8 {
"Capablanca's prophylactic manoeuvre. The inclusion of the moves f2-f3 and ...
Bb7 is definitely to the advantage of Black, since he can quickly begin a
siege of the c4-pawn, whereas for White it is more difficult to attack on the
kingside, since his queen is cut off from the g4 and h5 squares - Taimanov" -
Kasparov} (11... d6 {Would allow the unpleasant pin} 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bh4 {And
it is not advisable for Black to get rid of the pin by} g5 14. Bg3 Nh5 15. f4

probably wiser}) 16. Nxg3 cxd4 17. cxd4 {And White has a tremendous initiative}
) 12. Ng3 {[pgndiagram] A logical move, pursuing the plan of kingside attack.
"Black withdrew his knight, in order to prevent the pin Bg5 and to answer
f3-f4 with f7-f5, blocking the kingside. Therefore, before advancing his
f-pawn, White takes control of the f5-square (Bronstein)" - Kasparov} (12. Qa4

this move} Rc8 {Another Samisch move, pressuring the c5 pawn} 13. dxc5 Rxc5 14.
Be3 Rc8 15. Rfd1 d6 16. Nd4 {[pgndiagram] The engine claims White is OK here,
but in practical game I would much rather be Black; those doubled c pawns are
rather ugly}) 12... cxd4 (12... Ba6 {Mounting pressure on c4, was more
consistent}) 13. cxd4 Rc8 14. f4 $6 {[pgndiagram] Objectively, overstepping
the mark, but Geller wasn't interested in a draw} (14. c5 {"It is far quitere

sight, White's initiative more than compensates for the sacrificed pawn.
Bronstein writes that he 'needs only two moves to switch his queen and rook to
the h-file, after which it would appear that nothing will save the king. How
can the battery of the Rh4 and Qh5 be prevented? Is it possible that Black's
deep strategy was incorrect?!" - Kasparov} 16... b5 $3 {[pgndiagram]"The start
of a remarkable counterattacking plan, the basis of which is Black's advantage
on the central squares' - Bronstein. " Such moves are more beautiful than any
sacrifices! A path is simply opened for the queen to b6, and the weakness of
White's 4-pawn and of the g1-a7 diagonal immediately makes itself felt." -
Kasparov} (16... e5 $6 17. Rh4 exd4 18. Qh5 Ne5 19. Qxh7+ Kf7 {[pgndiagram]

apparent for White in any case. Still, the game move is far stronger}) 17. Rh4

difficult position} Nxe5 $2 {[pgndiagram] This move is not highlighted by
Kasparov, but it would appear it lets White back in the game} (18... h6 $1 {
This cold blooded machine reply is apparently much stronger. The point is that
White doesn't take h7 by force, but h6} 19. Bxh6 Nxe5 {And Black is close to

neverrhteless broken through. Black's position appears critical (Bronstein)."
- Kasparov} Kf7 22. Bh6 Rh8 $3 {[pgndiagram] The bolt from the blue, and the
most surprising move of the game - a defensive attacking sacrifice whose point
is diverting the white queen.   Objectively, there were other defensive moves
available, but this sacrifice sets White concrete problems that such a strong
player like Geller is unable to solve. The surprise value of the move is much
more important than its objective value sometimes.} (22... b4 $5 {Was
complicated, with the idea of} 23. axb4 (23. Rf1 {Is what Geller would have to

Kf1 Ra2 27. Bd2 Bc4+ 28. Kf2 Qb6+ {[pgndiagram] Etc. White can survive here,
although it is not easy to find all that over the board. Kasparov spends two
pages on the analysis of the continuation after 24 d5 and the objective
evaluation is equality. But that is with the help of the engines..}) 24...

this defence and that he scored some memorable victories with it, most notably
the one against Bogoljubow in Hastings, 1922} 3. g3 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Be7 {On this
occasion, Alekhine retreats the bishop. This idea is common - the assumption

what it is).   "A rather strange interpretation of the Dutch. In my view it is
better to erect the 'stonewall' by 7...d5; in that case the luring of the
bishop to d2 looks more justified. However, in the stonewall, Black is always
slightly worse.."} 8. O-O {[pgndiagram] Everything up to this point has been

adequate material (three pawns) for the piece." - Euwe    This move was rated
very highly. I agree: one has to give credit to Euwe's courage! At this
turning point of the match he played like Alekhine - he boldly launched his
knight at the enemy fortifications, sharply disrupting the quiet course of the
game. And although objectively there was little risk of White losing, for the

simply stunning and on the whole he outplayed his opponent in all phases of
the game and scored a deserving victory} 0-1
