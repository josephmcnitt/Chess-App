1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {[%csl Gc3][%cal Gc3d5,Gc3e4] The most logical move,
placing the knight on a square where he exerts max influence, but making it
vulnerable to the Bb4 pin. The alternative is to put it to the "more passive"
d2 square with 3 Nd2, leading to the Tarrasch variation, which will be
examined slightly later. The debate revolving around 3 Nc3 and 3 Nd2 (whether
one move is better or another) has been raging forever among those trying to
beat the French and general verdict is that 3 Nc3 is more critical, but also
more double-edged.} *
