{If I was following correctly, Kramnik played quite a few e4 games recently,
playing alot of Italian games, but also crushing the currently popular b6
variation of the French Steinitz.   But here he sticks to his most often first
move.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 g6 {I think that this setup against the Reti gained
popularity after Anand employed it against Carlsen in their matches. Although
it was played earlier on the top level as well.} 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 {[pgndiagram]
This was Carlsen's choice as well.  With this move order White transposes to
the symmetrical variation of the Grünfeld defence.} (4. c4) 4... Nf6 {
Transposing to the Grünfeld} (4... c6 {Was Anand's choice} 5. O-O Nf6 {But he
transposed all the same. Carlsen - Anand, World Championship 2013}) 5. O-O O-O
6. c4 {The main position of the Symmetrical Grünfeld. It is considered hard to
breach for White, if I am not mistaken.} c5 $5 {[pgndiagram] Too be honest, I
have never seen this move in this position untill now. Black tries to solve
his problems immediately by creating a tension in the centre. At the highest
level this is practically a novelty. I have only one game where this move was
played by 2700+ grandmaster. And moreover, it was a blitz game by Ian Nepomnia.
..Nepo..} (6... c6 {Is played far more often and this position was tabiya of
Kasparov - Karpov Leningrad/London 1986 match. Where Karpov didn't manage to
prove any advantage for White}) 7. dxc5 dxc4 8. Na3 $5 {[pgndiagram] A very
interesting move, White threatens the c pawn immediately} (8. Nc3 {Is a main
move according to my database.} Qa5 9. Qd4 Nc6 10. Qxc4 Be6 11. Qh4 Qxc5 12.
Be3 {And White is only slightly better.}) 8... c3 {A familiar theme. Black's
pawn is doomed, so it sacrifices itself in order to shatter the structure a
bit.} (8... Qxd1 9. Rxd1 Nbd7 {Black cannot copy White's play} 10. c6 bxc6 11.
Nd4 {And this position is highly in White's favour}) 9. Nb5 $1 {[pgndiagram]
An excellent move. White judges his c3 pawn will be doomed anyway, so he jumps
his knight to an active square instead.} (9. bxc3 {Is not a good idea} Ne4 10.
Qc2 Nxc3 (10... Nxc5 {Is also safe. c3 is weak forever}) 11. Bb2 Bf5 {And
Black is not worse} 12. Qb3 Nxe2+ 13. Kh1) 9... cxb2 10. Bxb2 Bd7 {[pgndiagram]
This is the first choice of the engine, but I don't like this move. Black's
bishop heads for c6, but moving the bishop twice gives White time to attain a
development lead} (10... Nc6 11. Ne5 {However also creates some uncomfort for
Black. It probably has to be concluded that Na3 - Nb5 plan challenges the 7..
c5 line seriously}) 11. Qb3 {White developes easily. Next is Rd1 - Rc1 and
knight on d4} Bc6 12. Rfd1 Qc8 $6 {[pgndiagram] An ugly move. Topalov was
probably psychologically not comfortable with the way the opening went.} (12...
Nbd7 {Was more natural, but also doesn't promise full equality} 13. Ne5 (13.
Rab1 $5 {Keeping the tension, might be more interesting}) 13... Bxg2 {I think
that simplification is acceptable for Black since he has less space} 14. Kxg2
Qc8 15. Nxd7 Nxd7 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Rac1 {And Black still has to suffer a bit})
(12... Qa5 $5 {Was also not to be ignored}) 13. Rac1 {Now White is very
comfortable} Nbd7 14. Nbd4 Bd5 {[pgndiagram] Black shouldn't allow the
exchange of this bishop} (14... Rd8 15. Nxc6 bxc6 {Is very bad for him} 16. Nd4
) 15. Qa3 {In many variations of the closed games, queen ends up on this
square. From here she indirectly threatens the e7 pawn, and potentially a7 as
well.   She controlls the dark squares because black's bishop is on g7 and
unable to challenge her.} Re8 {Anticipating c7 and defending the e pawn} 16. c6
$1 {[pgndiagram] Thematic blow in the position.} Nb6 $6 {All the same
continuing in the nervous style} (16... bxc6 17. Nxc6 Qb7 (17... Bxc6 18. Nd4 {
Is a bad idea}) 18. Nfe5 {And Black survives for now. Since the position is
symmetrical, nothing terrible for him is apparent yet.}) 17. c7 $6 {
[pgndiagram] Very tempting pawn push, but not the strongest move in the
position} (17. Ne5 {Was very strong} bxc6 18. Ndxc6 {And Black is very
uncomfortable. He already has to find some only moves.} Qe6 19. e4 Bxe4 20. Re1
Bxg2 21. Nxg6 Qh3 22. Nf4 {And White is close to winning. Look the difference
in the activity of the pieces}) 17... Nc4 {eliminating the bishop. White still
has an edge though} 18. Qb4 Nxb2 19. Qxb2 b6 {[pgndiagram] To be honest, I
didn't understand this move at first} (19... e6 {Weakens the d6 square} 20. Nb5
{And Black has to part with the exchange}) (19... a6 {Controlling the b5 seems
more natural to me} 20. Ne5 e6 21. Nc4 {But now the b6 is weakened and Black
probably has to part with the exchange} Qxc7 22. Nb6) 20. Qa3 $2 {[pgndiagram]
This let's Black completely in the game} (20. Ne5 {Was quite strong} Bxg2 (
20... e6 21. Nb5) 21. Kxg2 Nd5 22. Qb3 $1 e6 23. e4 Nxc7 24. Ndc6 {This knight.
Opening the d file. Black is dominated} (24. Nec6 Qb7) 24... Qb7 25. Rd7) 20...
e6 $2 {[pgndiagram] Returning the favour. The weakening of the d6 is fatal} (
20... Qb7 {Would force White to find some strong moves in order to keep his
initiative} 21. Bh3 e6 22. Ng5 {Removing everything from the weak diagonal and
threatening e4 things} h6 23. e4 Nxe4 24. Nxe4 Bxe4 25. Nb5 Bf8 26. Nd6 {
[pgndiagram] And this position is apparently favourable for White. But he
would have to see everything and decide to go for it. Which is not an easy
task.}) 21. Nb5 Bf8 $2 {Black is totally lost} (21... Ne4 {Also wouldn't help}
22. Nd2 Bf8 23. Qb2 Nc5 24. Nc4 {And Black will have to part with the exchange
sooner or later} Bxg2 25. Kxg2 Qb7+ 26. f3 Bg7 27. Qb4 {And White iis
completely winning}) 22. Qb2 {[pgndiagram] Hitting the knight and gaining a
tempo for the queen transfer} Bg7 23. Qd2 {There are many winning moves here
now. This one threatens Nd6} (23. Qc2 {Was probably more precise} Bf8 24. Ng5)
23... Qd7 {Defends the f7 in advance and also gains a tempo on the b5 knight} (
23... Ne4 {I was puzzled a bit why Black avoided this move} 24. Qf4 a6 25. Ng5
$3 {And this is the answer. White has too many threats} Nxg5 (25... Qd7 26.
Nxe4) 26. Nd6 Qd7 27. Nxe8 Rxe8 28. Qxg5) 24. a4 Ne4 25. Qf4 {[pgndiagram]
With the queen on d7 Qxe4 is threatened} a6 (25... Qe7 26. Nfd4 {Is also
winning for White}) 26. Qxe4 axb5 27. Qd3 {Threatening e4} f5 $2 {[pgndiagram]
But this loses immediately.} (27... Qe7 28. axb5 Rac8 29. e4 Bb7 {Is pretty
hopeless though}) 28. Ng5 $1 {Nxe6 is threatened and Black has no defence.
Topalov decided that he has had enough.} 1-0

1. e4 e6 {The French! A real refreshment after all the e4-e5 stuff we have
seen in the World Championship match. This is not Caruana's main move, but he
has played it here and there.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Moreovoer, an advance variation.
It seems like Topalov half-expected Caruana to go for the French.} c5 4. c3 Nc6
{The modern main variation of the French advance. I think that Black refrains
from playing his queen to b6.} (4... Qb6 {This move, puting pressure to the
centre, according to the Nimzowitsch principle, was main move in the past.
However, modern chess has become much more concrete and since than has been
regarded as a second option. Although it is a viable move nevertheless}) 5. Nf3
Bd7 6. Be2 Nge7 {[pgndiagram] The main line of the variation} (6... Nh6 {
Trying to get Nf5 without allowing Na3 is not the best} 7. Bxh6 gxh6 {Is
considered favourable for White}) 7. h4 $5 {A very rare move. White is
anticipating Ng6 in the future, and intending to gain some space on the
kingside (which is typical for French defence).} (7. O-O {Is the main line.
Which has been a speciality of Grischuk among others. There is also a very
nice game Svidler - Ivanchuk, Candidates 2013 featuring this line.}) (7. Na3 {
Is also played much more often than the text move.} cxd4 8. cxd4 Nf5 9. Nc2 Qb6
10. O-O Rc8 {And I think here Black has solved his opening problems.}) 7... Qb6
(7... h5 {Black can consider blocking the kingside and installing the knight
on f5.} 8. Na3 cxd4 9. cxd4 Nf5 10. Nc2 Qb6 11. O-O {And this is similar to 7
Na3 lines. However, it is doubtful whether inclusion of h4 and h5 benefits
White or not}) 8. Na3 {[pgndiagram] Nevertheless, White decides to go with the
knight on this square} (8. dxc5 {Might have some sense with the Black queen on
c5} Qxc5 9. h5 f6 10. exf6 gxf6 {And the position is unclear. At least to me :)
}) 8... cxd4 9. cxd4 Nb4 $6 {[pgndiagram] This is one of those complicated
subtle grandmaster moves that confuses me. Black's idea is to prevent the Nc2
move by White.   However I am not certain whether such subtle measures are
neccessary, since it removes the tension from the d4 pawn.} (9... f6 {The
standard french reaction was possible here}) (9... Nf5 10. Nc2 {Also has some
sense} Nb4) 10. h5 {Gaining some space on the kingside. Now the knight on f5
is always unstable due to g4} h6 {Stopping the h6 pawn from advancing, but it
is doubtful whether this is neccessary.} (10... Nf5 11. g4) (10... O-O-O {Was
possible} 11. O-O Nf5) 11. Bd2 {[pgndiagram] White is close to finishing his
developement. I think it can safely be said that he is slightly better out of
the opening, due to his better developement and more space on the kingside} a6
{It is a good quesion what should Black do in this position. His only active
possibility is going for the fast f6 break. However that is not possible
immediately} (11... f6 $6 {Black is not prepared for this} 12. O-O {White can
simply ignore this pawn} O-O-O 13. exf6 gxf6 14. Qc1+ Kb8 15. Bf4+) (11... Nec6
{Immediately was maybe slightly better} 12. Rh4 Rc8 13. Kf1 a6 {And White
retains some plus}) 12. Bc3 $6 {I don't like this move. I think White defines
the position of this bishop too early and also blocks the c file} (12. Rh4 {Is
also a stupid idea when Black can play Nf5} Nf5) (12. Kf1 {White should wait
for Nec6 to happen} Nec6 13. Rh4 O-O-O (13... Rc8 {Black should probably avoid
weakening of the f7 pawn}) (13... f6 14. exf6 gxf6 15. Nb1 {And the tempo that
White has gained by not playing Bc3 makes a big difference}) 14. Rf4 {And
White is better}) 12... Nec6 {Now Black can carry out the queenside castling}
13. Rh3 {[pgndiagram]} (13. Rh4 {Is not so dangerous now, since Black has
gained additional tempo} f6 (13... Be7 14. Rg4 O-O {And now there is no Bxh6
threat}) 14. exf6 gxf6) 13... O-O-O 14. Kf1 Kb8 {[pgndiagram] Black will be
ready soon for the opening of the f6} 15. Qd2 $6 {This move is not the best.
White had to do something more active then a simple developing move} (15. Rg3 {
Heading for the g6 square immediately, was probably better} f6 16. exf6 gxf6
17. Rg6 Be7 18. Nb1 {Heading for d2, is probably better for White. Although
Black maybe shouldn't rush with f6 in this instance}) 15... f6 $1 {Black takes
over the initiative} 16. exf6 gxf6 17. Rg3 {This move comes slightly too late.
Black manages to cover the g6 square.} Be8 18. Nh4 {Going for the g6 square
consistently} Bd6 $6 {[pgndiagram] This is an inaccuracy. Black had an
energetic alternative with which he could punish White's hesitation in the
opening.} (18... e5 $1 {Black gains serious initiative with this move} 19. Ng6
Bxg6 20. hxg6 Rg8 21. dxe5 fxe5 {And the central pawn duo is dangerous}) 19.

with this advance} 20. dxe5 (20. Ng6 {Is also possible, but rather not very
human} Bxg6 21. hxg6 exd4 22. Rd1 dxc3 23. bxc3 {Is a computer line}) 20...
fxe5 21. Ng6 Bxg6 {[pgndiagram]} (21... Bf8 22. Nxe5 {Is another reason why
letting the rook to g7 with Bd6 was not the best move in the position} Bxg7 23.
Nxc6+ Nxc6 24. Bxg7 Rh7 25. Bxh6 {And it seems that the engine will find the
way to equality, but for human position is rather unclear.   In any case,
White shouldn't be worse}) 22. hxg6 {Now the g pawn becomes an important
factor in the position} e4 $2 {This is a mistake. Opening the bishop diagonal
makes him into a powerhouse} (22... Rhf8 {Threatening f2} 23. Rf7 Rxf7 24. gxf7
Qc7 25. Bh5 Qe7 {Would still keep the initiative in Black's hands}) (22... d4
23. Nc4 {Is in White's favour}) 23. Rf7 {[pgndiagram] Gaining a tempo for the
pawn push} Rhg8 (23... Rhf8 24. Qxh6 Rxf7 25. gxf7 Qc7 {Is also i nwHite's
favour}) 24. g7 Ka7 {Black removes the king into safety. Since he has got no
other useful moves, it is clear that something has gone wrong for Caruana.} (

the chances for success}) 25. Qxh6 Nd3 $2 {[pgndiagram] The decisive mistake.
Ironically, it will be precisely the pawn on d3 that will ultimately decide
the issue in this game.} (25... Be5 26. Rd1 Qc5 {And Black is still alive}) 26.
Bxd3 exd3 {Now White is probably winning} 27. Re1 Bc5 $6 {[pgndiagram] This
counterplay is coming too late. Black would like to play the sequence Bxa3
with the rook on c8. But unfortunately he has to move the bishop first, since
Rc8 would leave it hanging} (27... d2 28. Bxd2 (28. Qxd2 $4 d4) 28... Qxb2 29.

Attacking the d pawn, was immediately decisive} d2 (28... Bxa3 29. bxa3 d4 30.
Bd2) 29. Bxd2 Rc8 30. b4 {And White is winning}) 28... Rc8 {Now there are Nb4
- Bxa3 ideas that White has to think about. I think that Topalov in his prime
would have calculated everything precisely and win. But that is pure
speculation} 29. Qg5 $2 {[pgndiagram] This move misses a hidden tactical
device that could swing the position completely in Black's favour} (29. Qg6 {
With analogy to the previous line, is now bad.} Bxa3 30. bxa3 d4 31. Bd2 Qb1+ {
And the removal of the rook from the first rank gives time and counterplay to
black}) (29. Qf6 {With the same idea is better.} Bxa3 30. bxa3 Qb5 31. Kg1 {

natural move loses here} (31. a4 {White should probably avoid making the king
move}) 31... d4 {[pgndiagram] And after this move Black is winning}) 30. Re1 $2
{The mistakes continue} (30. Qxd5 {Was much stronger} Bxc3 31. bxc3 Rgd8 32.

missed this deflection. This is a fascinating position} Rxd7 35. Rxb6 d2 36.

endgame is unclear to me. Although white definitely has practical chances})

amazing move} 31. Rxg7 Rh8 $3 {With the sudden mate threat} 32. g4 {An only
move} Bxc3 33. bxc3 Rh1+ 34. Kg2 Rxe1 {And White gets punished for 30 Re1}) 31.

whether he can win it}) 32... Rce8 33. Qd2 Rxe1+ 34. Qxe1 d4 $5 {The position
is, as they would say, in the state of dynamic equilibrium. But Black tries
his practical chance} 35. Nd2 $4 {The losing mistake. Topalov is the last one

safest. But it is hard to find such moves, especially with little time on the
clock.}) 35... dxc3 {Now it is game over. The Black pawn duo is simply too
strong} 36. Nc4 {[pgndiagram] Topalov surely missed Black's reply. If not for
the following intermezo, White would be probably winning after Qe3.} Re8 $3 {
A fabolous deflection that decides the issue. The Black pawn duo is stronger

had a preference for closed games.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 {To be honest, for the most
of his career the Semi Slav was Anand's main weapon as Black against d4.
However, it seems that he has recently switched to other systems. I have seen
him play alot of Ragozins/Viennas. Here he offers the Nimzo Indian.} 3. Nf3 {
Which is promtply being refused.} d5 {Going for the Queen's gambit setups} 4.

declare his intentions.} (4... c6 {Is the Semi-Slav}) (4... Bb4 {Is the Ragozin
}) (4... dxc4 {Is the Vienna move order}) 5. cxd5 {Nakamura choses to go for
the Carlsbad structure} (5. Bg5 h6) (5. e3 {Is some "Classical Queen's Gambit
Hybrid", without the bishop on g5}) 5... exd5 6. Bg5 Bb4 {[pgndiagram] And
nevertheless we have transposed to the Ragozin variation. The variation with
the knight d7 is the so called Westphalia variation.} (6... Be7 {Would go for
the main variations of the queen's gambit}) 7. e3 h6 $5 {Black's plan often
involves weakening of the pawn structure on the kingside in order to get rid
of the bishop.   I have analyzed some variations of the Ragozin and often seen
this idea. However, for some reason, Black players have more often avoided h6
in favour of the immediate advance of the c5.} (7... c5 {Was almost
exclusively played by the greatest Ragozin expert, Aronian. He has achieved
mixed results with it.}) 8. Bh4 $5 {This move is consistent, inviting black to
follow up with g5. This variation appeared only once on 2700 level, in a blitz

later} Ne4 9. Qc2 g5 10. Bg3 h5) 8... g5 9. Bg3 Ne4 {Pressuring the c3, but

typical. The best place for Black king is the g7 square. He cannot castle
since h6 is hanging.} (13... Nf6 {Heading for g4, was also possible} 14. Nf3

probably only has a slight plus, connected with the inevitable minority attack
with b5.}) 14. Qc2 Nf6 {Black choses this move nevertheless, when he is ready
to parry Nf3 with Kg7. However now White managed to castle queenside (since
with the queen on c2 Bxc3 is never going to happen)} 15. O-O-O Kg7 {Both
players have completed their development. White's active plans include f4 or

probably dynamically balanced} (15... Bxc3 16. Qxc3 Ng4 17. Rdf1) 16. Kb1 Be6

somewhat unnatural to me.} (17. Nf3 {Threatening Ne5 jump was possible} Bc7 18.

I think this agressive move is not very well timed.} (18. Na4 {Was consistent
follow up to b3, getting the knight on c5} Qe7 19. Nac5 {And here computer

another tournament to forget for Topalov, while Nakamura seems to gain some
momentum with his 2nd win in a row.} 1. e4 c6 {Caro - Kann is definitely a
rare opening for Nakamura. Last time he has played it in the Millionaire Chess
Open 2015. Altogether he has less than 20 games in my database on the Black

it is nowadays to play for the win as Black.   Topalov probably wanted to take
a respite and make an easy draw. Considering his tournament situation it made
some sense, but this game proves that even with Berlin it is hard to make a
draw when you are totally out of form.} 4. d3 {No endgame here, Adams chooses
to keep the queens on the board} Bc5 5. Bxc6 {[pgndiagram] This delayed
exchange has also become popular in recent times, together with 5 c3. The idea
of shattering Black's queenside structure is ancient in the Ruy Lopez.} (5. c3

topical nowadays, due to immediate knight jump} Nd4) 5... dxc6 6. Nbd2 {
[pgndiagram] White knight usually ends up on c4, and from there he heads for
e3, or even a5 in some variations. White thinks that static pawn structure
won't allow opening the position for the Black bishops.} Be6 {Preventing Nc4.

this variation. White prepares Lb2 and also bolsters the c4 square, for the
knight jump}) 7... Bd6 (7... Nd7 {Hinders the d4 plan for the moment, but
allows the one with Nb3} 8. Nb3 Bb6 9. Ng5 {Now there is no Bg4}) 8. d4 {This

year edition of the London Classic.} (8. b3 $5 {Was main choice of 2700+

create a spot for his bishop on f7 to keep his pieces more coordinated} (12...

Black is probably safe}) 17. Qxg7 {This seems rather dangerous, since White
will fall in developement. But actually it is a correct pawn grab for White.}

since White can't move his knight. But Adams has calculated precisely and
correctly judged that he will manage to extricate himself from this position}
19. Qe4 $1 {A key move. White doesn't have anything else} Qa6 $6 {Trying to
keep the queens on the board is very natural. However, objectively it is not
the best move in this position.} (19... Qd5 $1 {Offering the queen exchange
seems mad in this position, but Black's king is also weak and he retains his
activity even without the ladies.} 20. c4 $1 {While would have to find this
move} (20. Qxd5+ {Is a bad idea} Bxd5 21. Nf3 Raf8 {And Black has excellent
compensation}) 20... Qxe4 21. Nxe4 Bxc4 22. Nf6+ Ke7 {Black has to part with

exchange up, although converting it is by no means an easy technical task.})

for WHite} Rae8 $2 {After this Black is just lost, because tactics won't allow
him to intercept the queen f5 check.   But finding the best practical try was
not at all an easy task.} (20... Bd5 21. Qf5+ Kd8 22. Ne4 {And White is winning
}) (20... Raf8 {And now White should play the accurate} 21. c4 {Only this move
gives something tangible to White.} (21. Qf5+ Be6 22. Qxh7+ Kc8) 21... Kc8 22.

solution was also possible.}) 25... Bd4 26. Qd3 Qd6 27. Ne4 $6 {[pgndiagram]

practical hope for survival. Although objectively, White should be winning.})

endgame} Kc8 {There is nothing else} 29. Qxd4 Qg4 $2 {Trying to muddy the
watter, but Black will have none of that} (29... Qxd4 30. Rxd4 c5 {This gets

the test of time and remains one of the most fighting options against e4.} 6.

I know anything about it of course. Let's just say that this, together with
Be3 and Be2 (and h3 and Bc4) is one of the main moves.} (6. Be2) (6. Be3) (6.

the famous Poisoned Pawn variation} 8. Qd2 (8. a3) 8... Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 {And I

guess there are ideas connected with Be7 and Nxe4, when the bishop will be
hanging} 9. a3 {[pgndiagram] White avoid all complications and intends to play
the typical Sicilian position} (9. Qd2 {White can once again invite the
caputre on b2. I guess there is a hidden point behind h6  somewhere in the
forest of the Poisoned Pawn variation} Qxb2 10. Rb1 Qa3) 9... Be7 (9... Qxb2 $4

queenside, therefore this move is neccessary to safeguard the bishop.

a clear pawn up}) 10... Qc7 11. Qf3 Nbd7 12. O-O-O {[pgndiagram] A typical
Sicilian position has  arisen. The downside for Black is that castling is
dangerous for him, and he will have to keep his king in the centre.   That is
the downside of the h6 move.} b5 13. g4 g5 {[pgndiagram] The point of the

the Najdorf in Round 6, wants to play the White side of the opening against
the World's greatest Najdorf theoretician.} c5 {This was very much to be
expected. MVL is considered to be the greatest Najdorf expert.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4

analysis of Caruana - Nakamura game, many books have been written  only about
the certain lines of this rich opening.} 6. Bg5 {[pgndiagram] Nakamura copies
Caruana's play (obviously he was very impressed with his loss :) )} e6 7. f4 h6
{And MVL also copies Nakamura's play, avoiding the poisoned pawn variation} (

properly and simply avoid it in my games}) 8. Bh4 Qb6 9. a3 {[pgndiagram]
Neither player deviates so far. For the comments up to this point, please
check the analysis of the afore mentoned Caruana - Nakamura game.} Be7 10. Bf2

arisen. The position is very sharp and the cost of every move is very great.}

e pawn.} (13... g5 {Was Nakamura's own choice} 14. h4 gxf4 15. Be2 {And White
went on to win. Caruana - Nakamura, London Chess Classic 2016, Round 6}) 14.

queenside. I think that the further course of the game is very instructive as
it shows how complicated this Sicilian positions are} 15. Kb1 $1 {In this
particular position it is more important to improve the position of the king
than to "lash out" with some agresive moves.} (15. Rhe1 {Is not very useful
move} d5 16. e5 Ne4 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Qe2 {And the tempo lost by Rhe1 now

centre advance} e5 $1 16. Nf5 $2 Bxe4 $1 {And because of the mate threat on c2
Black wins}) 15... g5 $1 {Black still goes with this thematic move, blockading
the play on the kingside and winning the e5 square} (15... d5 {Is now met by}

now not good} 16. Nf5 Bxe4 17. Nxe4 Qxc2+ {And this is not mate}) 16. Qh3 $5 {
[pgndiagram] This queen move was suggested by the engine instead of h4 in the
Caruana - Nakamura game. It is certainly very interesting, as White now
threatens to take on g5} Nc5 $2 {And MVL is immediately rattled and makes a
step in the wrong direction. And a step in the wrong direction usually means
serious problems in the sharp Sicilian // I have to correct myself here.
Initially I thought that this move is bad, but after analyzing the
alternatives, it would appear that after 16 Qh3! Black's position is bad all
the same. It seems like improvement has to be found somewhere earlier. At
least Nakamura's preparation has cast serious doubt on the entire line.} (16...

this obvious capture} 17. g5 $1 {And White is probably winning already} Ng4 18.

Black is in trouble. It takes some time for the engine to realize that though}

Black though} 21. Rhe1 {And Black is all pinned} b4 22. Nd5 $1 exd5 23. h3 {
[pgndiagram] And amazingly, it seems that White is clearly winning here.
That's a Sicilian for you}) 17. Rhe1 h5 $1 {MVL plays very dynamically and
creates as much confusion on the board as possible. But unfortunately for him,
his position is very bad and White is spoilt for choice here.} 18. Nf5 $1 {
[pgndiagram] Very surprising sacrifice, but correct one} (18. fxg5 {Was more
prosaic} Nxg4 19. Bg3 {And White retains the initiative} Bxg5 20. Nf5) 18...
Ncxe4 {[pgndiagram] There is no way out for Black} (18... exf5 {Why Nakamura
avoids to take a clear piece?} 19. exf5 {Because after this primitive
recapture Black is in trouble with his king caught in the centre} Bxg2 20. Qxg2

best sign that Black is pretty helpless} (24. h6 {The computer enjoys this

seems that White has to play this sooner or later anyway}) 24... b4 $2 {
[pgndiagram] This try to complicate the play is understandable, but
objectively it doesn't create the greatest resistance} (24... Qe7 25. Qxf4 Qg5

pratical problems} (27... Rg2 {Would be the last practical chance} 28. Qxf4 e5

{I think that inviting Topalov to the tournament has really payed of for the
organizers.   Since he was involved in almost 50 % decisive games. Or more
precisely, 7/15.  However, I imagine he wasn't particularly happy about that
feat.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 {And once again we have
this variation, which is I think named the Harrwitz attack. It has almost
become the main line of the Queen's gambit, suplementing all the old Bg5 lines.
} O-O 6. e3 {[pgndiagram] I have to correect my analysis from the other games.
In this 5... 0-0 move order, White has to allow the early c5 possibility by
Black.} (6. c5 {Is not feasible} b6 7. b4 a5 8. a3 Ne4 {And Black takes over}
9. Nb5 axb4 {And the knight on b5 is undefended, which makes the Bxc7
impossible}) 6... c5 $5 {The immediate try to free the Black's position} (6...

years, and the GOAT has scored some brilliant victories in this line. Check
for instance Kasparov - Vaganian, Novgorod 1995} Nc6 9. Qc2 Re8 $5 {
[pgndiagram] This position is familiar to Anand, since he played the White
side of this position in the 2014 World Championship match. It is interesting
that here he choses the move originally prepared by the ... Magnus himself.} (
9... Qa5 {Was the old main line}) (9... d4 $2 {Is premature} 10. O-O-O Qe7 11.

recommend you to check the Anand - Carlsen, World Championship Sochi 2014 game

how the afore mentioned game continued} Be7 11. Rd1 Qa5 12. Bd3 h6 13. Bh4 dxc4

the idea behind Re8. White is at a crossroad} 11. Bg5 $5 {IMHO, the most
critical continuation} (11. cxd5 exf4 12. dxc6 Qc7 {Brings him very little}) (

Everything else virtually loses} 12. Nd5 b5 $1 {[pgndiagram] A tremendous
novelty  by team Anand. Apparently it was find by his second, a Polish GM
Grzegor Gajewski. It is very hard to determine the best move for White over
the board.} (12... Be7 {PReviously only this retreat occured} 13. Nxe7+ Qxe7

move, the threat of Qh5 has to be parried} 18. Nf5 {And now it seems that

board, with the clock ticking.}) 13... gxf6 14. cxb5 $6 {Not hard to blame
Topa for this one, but from the standpoint of the chess truth also not the best

objectively I would never ever play this as White gladly}) 15. cxb5) 14... Na5

"once in a while" possibilities, and always seems to find some moves that set
opponents some opening problems.  Unless that opponent's name is Magnus
Carlsen, though} (14... Qxd5 $6 15. bxc6 Be6 (15... Qxc6 $2 16. exd4) 16. Bd3)

pawn on f3} 22. Bd3) 22. Kb1 Rd8 {[pgndiagram] Now Black retains some edge,

better not to allow the Rc2 to come with tempo} (24. Bb5 Bf5+ 25. Ka1 Rc2 26.

that this is stronger, threatening the check on e6. Which would once again be
a double attack because of the bishop on e2}) 26. Rd1 {[pgndiagram]This tempo
move is important for White} (26. Bg4 $4 Qd4 {Just loses a piece}) 26... Qb6

be equal. Unfortunately for Topalov, when you are out of form, you lose

with such a king it is always uncomfortable to be constantly aware of the
Black's many threats} 29. Qb3 Bg6 30. Bf3 Rxf2 31. h4 $2 {Too be honest,this
rather nervous move should definitely be labeled as a mistake.} (31. Rd5 Qe1 (

should be careful}) 32. Qd1 {Is equal}) 31... Bc2 32. Rd8+ Kg7 33. Qc3 $4 {And
this is a terrible blunder. Qb5 should have been prevented at all cost} (33.
Qc4 Qe3+ 34. Ka2 Qc1 35. Qg4+ Bg6 {But I think that even here Black has great
chances to push for the win, and that the 31 h4 was the more critical mistake
than the 33 Qc3}) 33... Qb5 {And there is no good defence against the Qa4 mate
threat} 34. Qc6 (34. b3 Qa6+ 35. Kb2 Bxb3+ {Is curtains}) 34... Rxf3+ {And

the win with his great preparation and the inventive play in the opening.} 0-1
