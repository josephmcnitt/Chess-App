1. c4 {Adams is usually mainly an e4 player.} c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 {
Deviating from the symmetry as soon as possible and trying to solve the
problems immediately} (3... Nc6 {Is still most popular choice} 4. d3) 4. cxd5
Nxd5 5. e3 {[pgndiagram] Planning a fast d4 break.} (5. e4 $5 {This variation
also has many followers. GM Levon Aronian is one of it's main fans.} Nb4 6. Bc4
Nd3+ 7. Ke2 Nf4+ 8. Kf1 {And obviously there is alot of theory here.  Adams
choses a different approach}) 5... e6 6. Bc4 (6. d4 cxd4 7. exd4 {Would be
another way of reaching a typical isolani position}) 6... Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Qe2
{For the moment Adams delays the d4 break, in order to carry out the idea seen
in the game} Nc6 (8... b6 {Is the alternative, although it does look a bit ugly
} 9. d4 cxd4 10. exd4 Bb7 {Trying to develop the bishop first and preventing
the pawn sacrifice} 11. Re1 Bf6 12. Ne5 Nd7 {And after White takes on d5,
Black is probably slightly worse as well}) 9. d4 {[pgndiagram] Finally going
for his d4 break which now involves a pawn sacrifice} cxd4 10. exd4 Nb6 $6 {
Accepting the pawn sacrifice is probably not advisable here} (10... a6 11. Rd1
b5 12. Bb3 {Who knows what Adams has prepared here, but it seems that going
for the developement was more reliable for Black}) 11. Bd3 {This was obviously
Adams' preparation. He has spent only 5 minutes up to this point, compared
with almost half an hour for Salem} Nxd4 (11... Nb4 {It was still possible to
decline the bait and play for the control of d5, but once you said A, you
should probably say B as well} 12. Bb1 Bd7 13. a3 N4d5 14. Qd3 g6 {And White
has the better position and he hasn't lost a pawn to obtain the initiative.})
12. Nxd4 Qxd4 {[pgndiagram] So what has White gained in return for his pawn?
Well, he will gain multiple tempi on the Black queen, and Black's queenside is
undeveloped. Which will give White a long term compensation for the pawn} 13.
Rd1 {Threatening Bxh7+} Qh4 14. g3 Qh3 15. Be4 $1 {A key move. Which puts the
queenside under control} (15. Bf4 Bd7 {Black's bishop mustn't be allowed on c6}
) 15... e5 (15... Bd7 {Is now impossible} 16. Bxb7 Rab8 17. Bg2 Qf5 {Is much
better for White}) 16. Bg2 {The fianchettoed bishop is rather strong here} Qf5
17. a4 $1 {[pgndiagram] Great play by Adams. Now the knight on b6 also
experiences some discomfort.} (17. Be3 {Routine developement is to timid} Be6
$1 18. Bxb7 Rab8 19. Be4 Qg4 20. f3 Qh5 {And White is only slightly better here
}) 17... a5 {An intuitive reaction, but now White has the b5 square as well} (
17... Nd7 {Is very ugly  looking move though} 18. Be3 (18. Nd5 {Might be even
better} Bd8 19. Be3) 18... Nf6 19. a5 a6 20. Bb6 {And Black is still unable to
develop}) 18. Be3 Nd7 {[pgndiagram] There is nothing better, honestly.} 19. Nd5
Bd8 20. Rac1 {White is probably close to winning here. Black's pieces can
hardly move, while every single White's piece is almost on ideal square. Adams
achieves complete positional domination} Kh8 21. Qb5 (21. Nc7 {Obtaining the
bishop pair, came into consideration} Bxc7 22. Rxc7 {Although nothing tangible
for White is apparent yet}) 21... Nf6 22. Bc5 Rg8 {This move speaks for itself}
23. Ne3 {[pgndiagram] Maintaning the tension. It is instructive to follow how
Adams refuses to exchange the pieces, which is often a good idea when your
opponent has less space} Qh5 {It is hard to say whether queen should have
stayed closer to the centre} (23... Qe6 24. Bd6 (24. Nc4 {Is probably even
stronger} h6 25. Rd6 Qf5 26. Bb6) 24... e4 25. Bf1 {Is also rather unpleasant}
Ng4 {Trying to relieve his position} 26. Bh3 $1 f5 27. Nxg4 fxg4 28. Bf1) 24.
Bd6 (24. Nc4 {Now has less point than with the queen on e6} Be6) 24... Ng4 {
Black has no other move to defend e5} 25. Nxg4 Bxg4 26. Re1 {[pgndiagram] Now
White finally regains his pawn, while remaining with the active position} Ra6
$2 (26... Rc8 $1 {Was maybe the last chance} 27. Rxc8 Bxc8 28. Bxe5 f6 29. Bc3
(29. Bd5 $5 {Might be a serious improvement}) 29... Qxb5 30. axb5 Bd7 31. Rd1
Bxb5 32. Bxb7 h6 {And it is doubtful whether White has anything concrete in
this position after all. Of course, this is aproximate variation and probably
his play can be improved somewhere}) 27. Bxe5 Rb6 (27... f6 {Doesn't work here}
28. Bf4 Qxb5 29. axb5 {And the position of Black's rook on a6 gives a crucial
tempo to White} Rb6 30. Bd5 Rf8 31. Bc4) 28. Qd5 Qg6 {Bxg7 was threatened} (
28... f6 {Loses an exchange} 29. Bc3 Qxd5 30. Bxd5) 29. Be4 Qh5 $2 {A tactical
oversight} (29... Qe6 {Would have kept the fight going} 30. Bc3 Qxd5 31. Bxd5
Be6 32. Bxe6 fxe6 33. Re5 {And Black is not dead yet}) 30. Rc5 $2 {[pgndiagram]
Continuing the positional strangle, but Adams misses the opportunity to
conclude the game immediately with a spectacular tactical stroke} (30. Rc8 $3 {
Was just winning on the spot} Bxc8 31. Bxg7+ Kxg7 32. Qxh5 {And White has more
favourable version of the Queen vs rook and minor piece endgame that occured
in the game}) 30... Rh6 31. h4 b6 32. Rb5 Re6 $6 (32... Be2 {Is a nice
computer move. Black is trying to make something happen on the e-file} 33. Bd3
{White should go for the bishop exchange} (33. Rb3 {Removes the rook from
eyeying the h5 queen} Re6) 33... Bxd3 34. Qxd3 Qg6 35. Qd4 {And White still
has the upper hand}) 33. Qd4 {[pgndiagram] This battery is now deadly, because
tactics work in White's favour} f6 {The only move} (33... Qh6 34. Bd5) 34. Bxf6
{Winning the queen for rook and bishop} Bxf6 35. Rxh5 {[pgndiagram] Black
probably missed that he will get mated on h7. Therefore, his answer is forced}
Bxh5 36. Qc4 {Now only a "simple" technical task remains. I will give the
remainder of the game with only brief comments.} Rge8 37. Re3 Bxb2 38. Qb5 (38.
Bc6 Rxe3 39. fxe3 {Was probably easier, but still} Rxe3 {Is losing to} 40. Qf4)
38... Rxe4 39. Rxe4 Rxe4 40. Qxh5 {[pgndiagram] Now White's task is somewhat
complicated. He has to advance his kingside pawns under favourable
circumstances, while not giving up his a4 pawn. If Black plays h6, than
White's king can go to f7 and participate in mating attack} Bf6 41. Qd5 Rd4 42.
Qc6 h6 43. Kg2 (43. Qxb6 Rxa4 {Would probably make the winning task impossible.
White has to keep his pawn on the queenside}) 43... Rb4 44. Kh3 b5 $2 {
[pgndiagram] This is selfdestruction. The a-pawn doesn't promise enough
counterplay on it's own} (44... Kh7 {To me it wasn't immediately obvious what
should White do in case Black just waits} 45. h5 Kh8 46. f4 Kh7 47. Kg4 Bd4 48.
Kf5 $1 {And this is the point. Running toward f7 and trying to mate is the
solution} Bf6 49. Ke6 Bb2 (49... Bd4 50. Qe4+ Kh8 51. Qa8+ Kh7 52. Kf7) 50. Kf7
{And Black is getting mated}) 45. axb5 a4 46. Qa8+ Kh7 47. Qa5 Be7 48. Kg2 Kg8
49. b6 {Now White doesn't have that much work to do} Bf8 50. Qd5+ Kh7 51. b7 a3
52. Qd8 Rxb7 {[pgndiagram]} (52... a2 53. Qxf8 a1=Q 54. Qxb4) 53. Qxf8 Ra7 54.
Qc5 Ra8 55. Qd5 Ra7 56. Qa2 {Precise untill the end. Now White's king marches
toward the a -file, and queen finishes the game} h5 57. Kf3 Ra5 58. Ke3 Kh8 59.
Kd2 Ra7 60. Kc1 {Here Salem resigned, because he can't deal with the queen on
the kingside. One of the best games I have ever seen and a masterpiece by
Adams. I am impressed how he managed to control Saleh's pieces throughout the
whole game.} 1-0

1. b3 {This mustn't have come as a big surprise to MVL} d5 2. Bb2 Bg4 $5 {Too
be honest, I haven't seen this variation against b3 before. Which probably
says more about my chess education, I guess} 3. h3 (3. Nf3 Bxf3 {Is the point
of Black's idea, going for some sort of Trompovsky structure}) 3... Bh5 4. d3
Nd7 {Preparing e5} 5. g4 Bg6 6. f4 {[pgndiagram] And this is why we love
Richard Rapport.} e6 (6... e5 {Is amazing possibility suggested by my computer}

decent compensation for the piece} 10. Nf3 Qh6+ 11. e3 Nxf5 12. Qe1 Bc5 {And
that may well be so}) 7. Nf3 h5 $1 {Typical procedure against early advance of
the g pawn.} 8. g5 Ne7 9. Nh4 Nf5 $1 {Great judgement} 10. Nxf5 (10. Nxg6 {Is
worse for White actually} fxg6 11. e4 dxe4 12. dxe4 Ng3 13. Rg1 h4 {And
concrete chess triumphs over general positional guidances (bishop pair,
doubled pawns)}) 10... Bxf5 {[pgndiagram] Pretty natural. White is probably
slightly better in this position, but Black has normal development} (10... exf5
{Is actually not as stupid as it looks, since it stops the move e4 forever})
11. Bg2 (11. Nd2 $5 {Was very strong, stopping e5 for the moment} e5 12. e4)

on the g2 bishop} dxe4 13. dxe4 Bg6 14. f5 Qxg5) 12... exf4 13. Qxf4 Be6 14.
Nd2 Bd6 15. Qh4 Ne5 {[pgndiagram] Up to this point Richard has played
excellently and gained nice prospects with his creative play} 16. Nf3 (16.
O-O-O {Was interesting} Ng6 (16... a5 17. c4) 17. Qa4+ Qd7 18. Qxd7+ Kxd7 19.
e4 {And White has the initiative}) 16... Ng6 17. Qa4+ {[pgndiagram]} (17. Qf2 {
Doesn't present much problems. White has to play more concretely} O-O 18. O-O-O
c5) 17... Bd7 (17... c6 18. Bxg7 Rg8 19. Bf6 Qc7 {Is probably playable, but
why give up a pawn for nothing}) 18. Qd4 c5 19. Qe3+ {[pgndiagram]} (19. Qxg7 {
Is now an inferior version of a "I win a pawn scenario", since Black managed
to play d4} d4 20. O-O-O Be6) 19... Kf8 $1 {Now long castling is unavailable
to Black due to Bf4} 20. O-O $2 {And this seems to be a mistake. White's king
is too exposed on the kingside} (20. Ne5 {Blocking the dark squared bishop,
seems necessary now} Bxe5 (20... d4 21. Nxg6+ fxg6 22. Qf3+ Kg8 23. Qd5+) 21.
Bxe5 d4 22. Bd6+ Kg8 23. Qf2 Qa5+ 24. Kd1 {And the position is balanced}) 20...

White' pieces look disorganized} 21. Qd2 Re8 $2 {Giving some breathing space} (

better}) 22. e3 Kg8 23. d4 $6 (23. c4 {Is better than d4 for reasons that
aren't immediately apparent} Qc8 24. Qf2 Bxh3 25. Nh4 Rf8 (25... Be6 $4 26.

crucial role in the drawing combination} Kxg7 27. Qf6+ Kh7 28. Nxg6 fxg6 29.
Qxd6 Bxg2 30. Qe7+ Kg8 31. Kxg2 {And it ends with perpetual check}) 23... Qc8

pawn on h3 hanging, but this move is a decisive mistake} (24. Qf2 {Was still
better than what was plaed in the game} Bxh3 25. Nh4 Be6 {And this is possible
here. Black is far ahead, but it is still not completely over probably.}) 24...

should do instead} (25. Bxh3 Qxh3 26. Qg2 Qd7 {Looks horrible for White, with
so many weaknesses}) 25... Bxe5 26. dxe5 Bxg2 27. Qxg2 Qg4 {[pgndiagram] Not
bad. MVL choses a technical continuation, resulting in a winning endgame} (
27... Nxh4 {He could have taken on h4 immediately, but it requires tactical
precision. It is instructive to see how strong players choose more practical
moves.} 28. Qxd5 Qg4+ 29. Kh2 Re7 {But this is of course somewhat messy}) 28.

from Black is required. The remainder requires only brief commentary.} 35. Kg3

being active} (36... Rb8 {Is ugly, but apparently the strongest} 37. Kxg4 Kf8 {
And the king on e8 will dislodge the rook}) 37. Rxb7 Rd2 38. Ba3 Rxa2 39. Rxa7
Re2 40. Bc1 Rc2 41. Ra1 (41. Ba3 Rc3) 41... Rc3 42. Kxg4 Rxb3 {Now Black is a
clear pawn up, has a better minor piece and a better pawn structure} 43. Kf5
Rd3 44. Ra8+ Kh7 45. Ra7 Rd1 46. Rxf7 {Desperation} Nd8 47. Rc7 Rf1+ $1 {A
good check, moving the king away from the action} (47... Rxc1 {Is less precise}

) 48. Ke4 Rxc1 49. Rc8 Nf7 50. Rc6 Nh6 51. e6 Ng8 52. Rc7 Nf6+ 53. Ke5 Kg6 54.
e7 Re1 {A very interesting and tense game. Unfortunately for Rapport, I think
that it is in this kind of tactical positions that MVL excels, and this time
he hit the rock with his approach. But kudos for bravery and entertaining us
all nevertheless.} 0-1

1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 $5 {Here we go. The Chigorin defence is rarely seen on top
level, if we disregard the games of Richard Rapport.} 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. cxd5 Bxf3 {
Necessary exchange, getting rid of one defender of the d4 pawn} (4... Qxd5 5.
Nc3 {And White is virtually winning already}) 5. gxf3 Qxd5 6. e3 e5 7. Nc3 Bb4
8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. bxc3 {I think this can be regarded as the tabiya of the
Chigorin defence. It is obvious that White is better, due to the open b-file,
massive centre and bishop pair. I think it goes without saying that White has
emerged better out of the opening.} Qd7 {[pgndiagram] A new move. I am not
entirely certain of the reasons behind this move. I guess Black's idea is to
go for the queenside castling without leaving the h7 pawn hanging.} (9... Qd6 {
Is the only move in my database} 10. Rb1 b6 (10... O-O-O {Alas, is now
impossible, since f7 is hanging} 11. Qb3) 11. Rg1 g6 12. f4 exf4 13. e4 {And
White is better}) 10. Rb1 O-O-O 11. Bg2 {[pgndiagram] Nakamura goes for the
logical development without trying to be too smart. I have noticed that he has
adjusted his style to be more solid in the last couple of years.} (11. Qb3 {Is
playable though} b6 12. Bb5 Kb7 13. Rg1 g6 14. f4 f6 {And I think White's

have anywhere to go from f6} 12. O-O Rhe8 13. Qa4 {And White can start opening
the position} Kb8 14. f4) 12. Qb3 {[pgndiagram] Nakamura decides to take the
pawn} (12. O-O Ng6 {Preventing f4, is one of the main ideas of the Nge7. Also
Nh4 is an option here} 13. f4 Nh4 14. fxe5 Nxg2 15. Kxg2 Nxe5 {Is not very
clear}) 12... b6 13. Qxf7 Rhf8 14. Qc4 {[pgndiagram] It is doubtful whether
Black has full compensation for the pawn. White has no weaknesses, and he only
needs to complete his development to be completely comfortable. I think that
Rapport's opening experiment has failed} (14. Qh5 {Keeping the queen in
vicinity of the king, might be better try for consolidating the pawn advantage}

practical game}) 14... Kb8 15. O-O g5 $2 {[pgndiagram] Actually, in hindsight,
it is only with this move that the tide definitely turns toward Nakamura.} (

1. d4 {As far as I know, Mamedyarov is primarly a d4 player} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
Nc3 d5 {Adams is pretty regular Nimzo Indian player, but I guess he felt that
it would be an obvious target for Mamedyarov's preparation} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5
c6 6. e3 h6 {[pgndiagram] In the past, this move was considered as a sin in
the Carslbad's structure, but times have changed. Nowadays h6 is customary,
and is often followed up by the Nf6-Nh5 maneovre} (6... Be7 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Qc2
O-O 9. Nf3 Re8 {Is approximately how this position was treated in the past.
Black's most usual plan included Nf8-Ne6-g6-Ng7-Bf5 with exhcange of light
squared bishops. But such a time consuming maneovre gives alot of time to
White to choose between various plans}) (6... Bf5 7. Qf3 Bg6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9.
Qxf6 gxf6 {Is an endgame that some players like Short and Andreikenventured to
defend with Black, but I haven't seen it that often since Magnus crushed
Kramnik in this line}) 7. Bh4 Be7 8. Bd3 Nbd7 9. Nge2 Nh5 {[pgndiagram] Here
we go. This move has become standard in various positions of the Carlsbad
structure. Black exchanges dark squared bishops and liberates his position
somewhat  I remember GM Bogdan Lalic commenting that similar positions are
rock solid for Black and that it is hard to play for the win} 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11.
Qd2 Nb6 {With this useful move Black is waiting for White to declare where he
intends to put his king} (11... O-O 12. O-O-O b5 13. g4 {Might be dangerous
for Black, but this position requires further investigation}) 12. f3 Bd7 13.
O-O {[pgndiagram]} (13. O-O-O O-O-O {Usually Black mirrors White's king
positioning in these positions}) 13... O-O 14. g4 $5 {Typical Mamedyarov.
Immediately after castling he advances a pawn in front of his own king} (14. e4
{Seemed more natural but it is perhaps too hasty} dxe4 15. fxe4 c5 16. d5 Rae8
{And the position is pretty double edged}) 14... Nf6 15. Ng3 {[pgndiagram]
White plans e4, but now this advance will always include the sacrifice of the
g4 pawn} Ne8 $6 {Transfering the knight on d6, eyeing c4 in the future. But I
am not certain if this is the best, considering how quickly White managed to
build his initiative} (15... Rfe8 {Perhaps going for the c5 plan was more
logical} 16. Rae1 c5 {Black could have considered counteraction in the centre}
17. Qf2 cxd4 18. exd4 Qd6 19. Bf5 Rac8 {And the position is probably equal})
16. Rae1 Nd6 17. e4 $1 {[pgndiagram] This is the reason i like Mamedyarov's
style. It is never boring to watch his games. Now the pace switches from slow
positional maneovres to more tactical play} dxe4 18. fxe4 Ndc4 19. Qc1 {White
doesn't want to part with his light squared bishop} (19. Bxc4 Nxc4 20. Qe2 {
And the g4 pawn doesn't fall} Qb4 21. Rf2 {But it is doubtful whether White
has the advantage with such awkward rook maneovres}) 19... Bxg4 {Black has won
a pawn, but I think that White has dangerous initiative. It is even more hard
to meet this over the board} 20. b3 Rad8 $2 {[pgndiagram] The very first move
after the acceptance of the sacrifice turns out to be a serious mistake. Black
decides to give up a piece, but he shouldn't have real compensation} (20... Na3
21. e5 Be6 22. Nce4 Rfd8 23. Nf6+ Kh8 24. Qe3 {And White also has the
initiative, but not yet the decisive one}) (20... Nd6 21. e5 Nb5 22. Nxb5 cxb5
{Was also probably better than the game continuation}) 21. Nf5 (21. Bxc4 Nxc4
22. Nf5) 21... Bxf5 22. exf5 Qf6 23. Bxc4 Nxc4 24. bxc4 Qxd4+ 25. Kh1 {
[pgndiagram] So Black has sacrificed a piece and has some counter chances
based on the weak pawns and the weak White king. But still, Idoubt that the
compensation is sufficient} Rfe8 {c4 isn't running anywhere} (25... Qxc4 {
Taking this pawn would have allowed the activation of White rooks.} 26. Rg1 Kh7
27. f6 g6 28. Re7) 26. f6 Rxe1 (26... g5 {Was interesting} 27. Re7 Rxe7 28.
fxe7 Re8 29. Re1 Qd3 30. Re3 Qxc4 31. Qd1 {And White is again probably winning}
) 27. Qxe1 Qxc4 {[pgndiagram] Probably it was better to avoid the exchange on
g7, but in this irrational position it is hard to make judgement} (27... g6 28.
Qe7 {Is also unpleasant though} Rf8 $4 {Just to illustrate how quickly Black's
position can go wrong} 29. Rd1 Qxc3 30. Qxf8+) 28. fxg7 Rd6 29. Rg1 $2 {
[pgndiagram] Virtually the first real mistake by Mamedyarov in this game,
which probably lets Black completely in the game} (29. Qe8+ Kxg7 30. Qe5+ Kg8
31. Rf3 Qe6 32. Qf4 Kf8 33. Ne4 {And Black's king's position should be
exploitable for White}) 29... Rg6 30. Qe5 (30. Rxg6 fxg6 31. Kg2 Kxg7 {And it
is hard to believe White can win this position}) 30... Qe6 $2 {And alas, the
last mistake is made by Adams} (30... Rxg1+ 31. Kxg1 b5 32. Qf6 Kh7 33. Kf2 {
Is probably sufficient for a draw}) (30... Qd3 {Was the strongest, threatening
Qf3} 31. Qe8+ Kxg7 32. Rxg6+ Kxg6 33. Qe4+ {White doesn't have anything better}
Qxe4+ 34. Nxe4 {And the endgame is equal}) 31. Qb8+ Kxg7 32. Qxa7 {[pgndiagram]
Amazingly, Black's queen doesn't have a constructive check} Qc4 33. Qe3 {This
is clearly very inferior version for Black of the endgame just considered.} b5
34. a3 c5 35. Ne4 f5 $2 {And this is desperation which hastens Black's end} (
35... b4 36. axb4 cxb4 37. Rxg6+ fxg6 {Was far from easy for White}) 36. Rxg6+
Kxg6 37. Nxc5 Qd5+ 38. Kg1 Qd1+ 39. Kg2 Qd5+ 40. Kh3 Qd1 41. Qe8+ Kf6 $2 {The
final mistake, allowing the immediate finish} (41... Kg7 42. Ne6+ Kf6 43. Qd8+
Qxd8 44. Nxd8 {Was pretty hopeless as well, though}) 42. Nd7+ Kg5 43. Qg8+ {
And due to} Kf4 44. Qg3+ Ke4 45. Nf6+ Kd4 46. Qd6+ {Black resigned. An
unfortunate end for Adams, since both sides played creatively and
imaginatively. However, it is not wrong to say that Shakh has well deserved
this full point} 1-0

{For this game, Adams returns to his main first move.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bc4 {When I first started playing chess seriously, somewhere in the year 2011,
common courtesy was that the Italian game was an automatic draw.  Little did
we all suspect that it will become the most popular way of avoiding the Berlin
defence.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 a6 6. c3 d6 7. a4 O-O {[pgndiagram] Everything
has been seen many times on the highest level so far and probably the main
tabiya of the Italian game has been reached} 8. Re1 (8. Bg5 {Is the other main
move here} h6 9. Bh4 Ba7 (9... g5 {Is risky due to knight sacrifice} 10. Nxg5
$5 {Probably shouldn't work in this position,a lthough a recent Carlsen -
Karjakin game from Tata Steel 2016 proved that Black has to reckon with this
sacrifice} (10. Bg3 g4) 10... hxg5 11. Bxg5 Kg7 12. Qf3 Rh8 13. Nd2 Ba7 14. Bd5
Nb8 {And White doesn't have anything direct, but he isn't worse by any means
since it isn+t easy for Black to disentangle.   In practice this is definitely
playable}) 10. Nbd2 a5 {Is safer}) 8... Kh8 {[pgndiagram] This is a novelty
and not a particularly succesful one.} (8... h6 {and}) (8... Ba7 {Have been
both played before}) 9. h3 h6 10. Na3 $5 {An interesting decision. White's
knight takes the a3-c2 route toward e3 without interfering with the c1 bishop
and more importantly, the queen} (10. Nbd2 {Would reveal the point of the
misterious king move to h8} Ba7 11. b4 (11. Nf1 Be6) 11... Nh5 12. Nf1 f5 {And
Black gets active counterplay}) 10... Bxa3 {Not the most obvious, but by no
means bad} (10... Ba7 11. b4 {Leavs white better} (11. Nc2 {IS also an option,
probably even a better one}) 11... Ne7 (11... Nh5 {Is now met by} 12. d4) 12.
Nc2 Ng6 13. Be3 {And with Black losing time for Kh8 leaves White in a good
version of the Italian}) 11. Rxa3 Be6 12. Bxe6 fxe6 13. d4 {[pgndiagram] Also
a typical procedure. White usually immediately undoubles the pawns on e-file
for lively piece play} (13. Qb3 Qc8 14. a5 {Came into consideration, but then
the rook is somewhat stupid on a3}) 13... Qe8 $6 {I think that this move
leaves Black too passive in the resulting structure.} (13... exd4 14. cxd4 Qd7
15. Rae3 {And by this neat rook maneovre White prepares d5 and can count on
advantage}) (13... Nd7 {Comes into consideration as well}) 14. dxe5 Nxe5 {
[pgndiagram]} (14... dxe5 15. b4 {Is even worse for Black} Rd8 16. Qe2) 15.
Nxe5 dxe5 16. a5 {A good move, gaining space on the queenside and restricting
Black's pawns} Rd8 $6 (16... Nh5 {Was the main alternative} 17. Rb3 Rb8 18. Rb4
Qf7 19. Be3 Nf4 20. Qc2 {And White retains some advantage}) 17. Qe2 $2 (17. Qb3
{Was very strong, with pressure on b7} Rb8 (17... Qc6 18. Ra4 {Is no better})
18. Ra4 {And Black already has to make a concession} c6 19. Be3 {White is
close to winning}) 17... Qc6 18. Rb3 Rd7 19. Rb4 Rfd8 20. Be3 Kg8 {[pgndiagram]
Finally Black moves the king back, admiting that his opening experiment wasn't
the best ever} 21. Qc4 Rd1 $6 {It seems like keeping one pair of rooks
increased Black's defending chances. Without the rooks, White's bishop might
attack e5 from the b8 square ( since Black's remaining rook has to cover b7
from the d7 square)} (21... Qxc4 22. Rxc4 c6 23. Bb6 Rf8 {And nothing terrible
for Black is apparent. White's king is less strong when there are two rooks
threatening checks}) 22. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 23. Kh2 Qxc4 24. Rxc4 c6 25. Rb4 Rd7 26.
Kg3 {[pgndiagram] Now on the contrary, White's king takes active part in the
endgame without being harassed. It is magnificent to watch how Adams
accumulates slight pluses.} Kf7 27. Kf3 g5 {Black has to gain some space on
the kingside. Unfortunately, this weakening alows the undermining h4 move} (
27... Ng8 {Against passing waiting White has the following construction - h5-
Kh4-g4-c4 -Rb3 -Rf3+} 28. h4 Ne7 29. Kg4 Kf6 30. h5 Kf7 31. Kh4 Kf6 32. Rb3 Kf7
33. c4 Kf6 34. g4 Nc8 {Preventing Ba7} 35. Bc5 Kf7 36. Rf3+) 28. Ba7 Ng8 29. h4
$1 {[pgndiagram] A great move, allowing the entrance of the White king} gxh4 (
29... Kg6 {Came into consideration, letting the pawn on e5 fall} 30. Bb8 gxh4
31. Bxe5 (31. Kg4 {Is now not an option, as in the game, because the bishop
doesn't cover the c5 square} Kf6 32. Kxh4 Ne7 33. Kh5 c5 {And here White even
loses his bishop}) 31... Nf6 {And Black retains some practical chances}) 30.
Kg4 Ne7 (30... Kf6 {Is now not a possibility} 31. Kxh4 Ne7 32. Kh5 {And now c5
is not an option, and White is winning}) 31. Be3 Ng8 {[pgndiagram] There is
not much that Black can do but wait passively.} 32. Kxh4 Ke8 $2 {This seemed
illogical. Black probably considered moving the king toward c8, but he simply
doesn't have time for that} (32... Kg6 {Preventing the entry of the opposing
king seemed more logical. White wouldn't have the immediate win as in the game}
33. Ba7 Ne7 34. c4 Kh7 35. Kh5 Ng8 36. f3 Nf6+ 37. Kh4 {And the game still
continues}) 33. Rb3 $6 (33. Kh5 {Was probably stronger, why not take the pawn}
Kf7 34. Bxh6 Nf6+ 35. Kh4 Kg6 36. Be3 Rh7+ 37. Kg3 {And White retains all the
pluses, and has the extra pawn}) 33... Rg7 $6 {[pgndiagram] Hammer probably
didn+t want to defend passively and that hastens his end} (33... Kf7 {Is
probably preferable}) 34. g4 Rf7 $6 (34... Rd7 {With Kf7 next is again to be
prefered}) 35. c4 Rd7 36. Ba7 Nf6 37. f3 Rf7 38. Bb8 Nd7 39. Bd6 {[pgndiagram]
It is clear that White has skillfully managed to extricate maximum out of his
position, and he will soon reap the rewards of his instructive play} Kd8 40.
Kh5 Rf6 41. Rd3 Ke8 42. Bb4 c5 43. Bd2 Rf7 44. Bxh6 {With the fall of h6 the
passed g pawn will decide the issue.} Nf6+ 45. Kg6 Ng8 46. Bg5 {A brilliant
technical win by Adams, in the style of Capablanca, Karpov or Fischer from his
best days.} 1-0

and he already played it against MVL in this tournament} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4

line, which is what MVL also did.} (5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 {Is definitely much
more trendy in the 21st century. But opening fashion chances quick}) 5... d5 6.

many moves} (6... Nc6 {Is a possibility}) (6... Bg4 7. h3 {Is not the best here

have repeated the MVL - Li Chao b game from the round one.   However by doing
so, Li Chao presented an obvious target for Nepo to prepare. And boy did he
prepare.} 12. Bg5 {Nepo is the first to deviate from the afore mentioned game}

is probably fine in this variation with best play.}) 12... Qc7 (12... Qa5 {

} 19. g4 {Now doesn't work} Bd8 20. g5 f5 $1 {[pgndiagram] With the rook on f8,
this move really hurts White}) 19. a4 $6 {This creates another weakness} (19.

pawn}) 24. O-O {[pgndiagram] Finally deciding to castle, but now this is

Now Black's position really looks threatening} 26. Qd3 (26. g4 Bxh4) 26... Kh8

concrete variation, or more on general grounds, in accordion with the "Don't
hurry" principle} (26... Bc8 {Exchanging the bishop defending the king, was
even better} 27. Bxc8 Qxc8 28. Ne2 Nxe2 29. Qxe2 Ra7 $1 {A common maneovre of
the rook} 30. Rc3 (30. c5 {Is maybe what bothered him, but I don't see what it
has to do with the king position} bxc5 31. Nc4 Qe6) 30... Raf7 {And Black is

sacrificing the d6 pawn} (33... Qe6 {Was perfectly possible and slightly more
pragmatic. It is hard for White to make a move} 34. g4 Bxh4) 34. Rxd6 {Now
White at least has some weaknesses to play against on e5 and a6 if he survives
the onslaught.} Bxh4 $1 {Of course, this sacrifice can't be accepted, but
Black has to find the follow through} 35. Rd5 $1 {Topalov defends very
resilliently from this point onwards} (35. gxh4 f3 36. Qe3 Rf4 {Is of course,
game over soon}) 35... f3 $4 {And this move, releasing the tension is wrong

improving the position, was in order} 36. Rxe5 Bb6 37. Nf3 (37. c5 {Is better}

also White can use the same theme as in the game} 38. Rh1 {And everything is

to mantain the balance} (38. Rxe5 {Would transpose to the previous note}) 38...

nonexistent} (38... Bxd2 {It was time to admit that the win is gone. But
psychologically it is really hard to adjust} 39. Qxd2 Qxe4 40. Re1 Qxa4 41.

convert another good position after failing to beat Mamedyarov in the previous
rounds.} 1-0
