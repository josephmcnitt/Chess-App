1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {There you have it. There are some players rated around 2300
who play the Trompovsky on a regular basis (and quite successfully) in Croatia)
} d5 {One of the main moves. Cox recommends 2...e6, but Karjakin has his own
opinion} 3. e3 {Prior to taking on f6 White waits a bit to see what Black will
do.} c5 4. Bxf6 {The logical idea in this opening... White gives up the bishop
to spoil the pawn structure.} gxf6 {Toward the centre is more logical, not to
isolate the d pawn} 5. dxc5 {This has all been played before.} Nc6 {This was
Giri's move in Caruana - Giri, London Classic, 2015} (5... e6 {Was Kramnik's
choice, but he quickly went astray} 6. Nf3 {And now instead of taking the pawn
with the bishop he played} Nd7 {planning to take with the knight, but there
followed} 7. c4 dxc4 8. c6 {With advantage to White, Carlsen - Kramnik, Tal
Memorial, 2013}) 6. Bb5 $5 {[pgndiagram]A new move, Caruana went c3 but didn't
achieve much} (6. Nc3 e6 7. Qh5 {Is the main line, that is scoring pretty well
for White to be honest (65% in my database)}) 6... e6 {Simple chess} (6... a6 {
Is also possible, but this way Black doesn't regain the pawn immediatelly} 7.
Bxc6+ bxc6 8. Nd2 e5 9. b4 a5 10. c3) (6... Qa5+ 7. Nc3 a6 {Would have
regained the pawn, but lost some time and White would enjoy that}) (6... Rg8 {
Is mentioned by GM Hess in his analysis, but it is better to reserve the right
to castle} 7. Nc3 e6 8. g3 {And with Qh5 coming it will be enjoyable for White}
) 7. c4 (7. b4 a5 8. c3 Bd7 9. Nf3 axb4 10. Bxc6 Bxc6 11. cxb4 b6) 7... dxc4 8.
Nd2 {Keeping the queens gives more chances.} Bxc5 9. Ngf3 O-O 10. O-O $1 {
Logical and natural} (10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. O-O Ba6 {Does compromise Black's
structure, but gives no chances of advantage, the bishops are very strong})
10... Na5 11. Rc1 {[pgndiagram] Up to here Magnus was playing instantly,
signalling that he was still in his preparation} (11. Qc2 {Was a possibility,
to capture on c4 as fast as possible without allowing queen exchange} Be7 12.
Nxc4 Qc7 {However also doesn't bring White alot}) 11... Be7 12. Qc2 (12. Nxc4 {
Taking on c4 doesn't bring much, but Black has to be somewhat careful} Qxd1 (
12... a6 $1 {[pgndiagram] Is very accurate computer suggestion} 13. Qxd8 Bxd8
14. Nd6 Be7 15. Nxc8 Raxc8) 13. Rfxd1 Nxc4 14. Bxc4 {With slightly more
pleasant position for White due to development lead}) 12... Bd7 $1 {Now Black
has more or less equalized} 13. Bxd7 Qxd7 14. Qc3 Qd5 (14... b6 {Was
interesting} 15. Nxc4 Rac8 16. Qd2 Qxd2 17. Ncxd2 {And equality is even more
clear}) 15. Nxc4 Nxc4 16. Qxc4 (16. Rfd1 {Is both GM Hess and computer
suggestion. White seizes the d file while the c4 knight isn't going anywhere.
However, it is doubtful whether that is advantageous to him} Qb5 17. Qxc4 Qxc4
18. Rxc4 Rac8 19. Rxc8 Rxc8 {And he doesn't have time to go Rd7 because of
bank rank problems}) 16... Qxc4 17. Rxc4 {[pgndiagram]Here it is time to take
a stop. Most of us would be faster to leave the board at this state than
Golden State Warriors fans are when their team is blowing the 3-1 lead in the
final. However I think it is very instructive how Karjakin eliminates even
these slight chances that Magnus had to create some problems. But why should
Magnus have chances at the first place. Well, White's pawn structure is better,
and he is first to seize the open file. However, amount of Black's weaknesses
and his good bishop easily deal with that.} Rfc8 {Exchanging a pair of rooks}
18. Rfc1 Rxc4 19. Rxc4 Rd8 20. g3 (20. g4 {Would put a pawn on a light square
and restrict the bishop somewhat, but would not change the evaluation}) 20...
Rd7 {Not allowing Rc7} 21. Kf1 f5 22. Ke2 Bf6 23. b3 Kf8 24. h3 h6 {The knight
wasn't going anywhere from f3, so it is time to reroute it} 25. Ne1 Ke7 26. Nd3
{When playing such endgames it is very hard, at least for me, to decide where
to advance the pawns, which pawns to advance, etc etc} Kd8 27. f4 {[pgndiagram]
This is the instance I don't understand completely. Now h pawn can never be
attacked by the rook, g pawn is somewhat weakened and stuff. Carlsen admitted
that he planned on going Ne5 and then winning some superior endgame, but as he
said, "it was a mirage"} h5 28. a4 {In any case White didn't miss big chances}
Rd5 {Keeping the rooks. Sometimes it is easier to steer for clarity, but often
exhcanges leave the pushing side satisfied.} (28... Rc7 {Would have been
something that White was aiming for} 29. Rxc7 Kxc7 30. Ne5 Bxe5 31. fxe5 Kc6
32. Kf3 {[pgndiagram] And i think that this pawn endgame is won for White}) 29.
Nc5 b6 30. Na6 Be7 31. Nb8 (31. b4 b5 32. axb5 Rxb5 {Is equal}) 31... a5 {
White was threatening Nc6 - Nxa7} 32. Nc6+ Ke8 33. Ne5 Bc5 34. Rc3 {Now there
really isn't very much going on, and players will be quick to agree a draw.}
Ke7 35. Rd3 Rxd3 36. Kxd3 f6 37. Nc6+ Kd6 38. Nd4 Kd5 39. Nb5 Kc6 40. Nd4+ Kd6
41. Nb5+ Kd7 42. Nd4 Kd6 {Very correctly played game and probing game from the
Champion. By going with the Trompovsky he basically avoided all Karjakin's
preparation and, as on numerous instances before, tried simply to play chess.
However, this time, it didn't quite work, but i doubt that Magnus will be
deeply depressed after this game, as he didn't miss serious chances, and he
has another game very soon anyway.} 1/2-1/2

1. e4 {A somewhat expected start to the match by Karjakin.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bb5 {So, we will have the Ruy Lopez after all. I think more people (myself
included) expected the Italian game more.} a6 {But this is the real surprise.
Black avoids the Berlin endgame and goes for the "old mainline" of the Ruy.} (
3... Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {Is the
modern tabiya of the so called Berlin endgame}) 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 (5...
Nxe4 {Would lead to the so called Open variation of the Ruy Lopez} 6. d4 b5 {
Note that now Nd6 is impossible, since it doesn't gain tempo on the bishop, so
there is no endgame. The result of the move 3..a6} 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 {With
loads of theory}) 6. d3 {This solid approach has overtaken the historical main
lines recently.} (6. Re1 {Is the move known already in the 19th century.} b5 7.
Bb3 O-O {And in this position White can go} 8. d3 {In order to avoid the
Marshall attack} (8. c3 d5 {[pgndiagram] Is the theoretical and heavily
analized Marshall attack, played first in the game Capablanca - Marshall, New
York, 1918.})) 6... b5 7. Bb3 d6 {[pgndiagram]In this position White is at the
crossroads. His plan in this position is to play slowly and first develop his
pieces, and then eventually go for d4 under more favourable circumstances. I
think that this approach of controlable agression is dominant in the modern
treatment of the "Queen of openings".} 8. a3 {Karjakin chooses the more modest
pawn move. The idea of this move is to preserve the bishop from being
exchanged by Na5} (8. a4 b4 {And now black has ideas like Na5-Rb8-b3, for
instance. This leads simply to another type of position, and White choice is
most probably matter of taste and preference}) 8... O-O 9. Nc3 {Typical idea
is to jump with the knight on d5 and follow it up with c3-d4} Na5 10. Ba2 Be6
$5 {A modern move} (10... c5 11. b4 $1 {Typical Ruy Move} Nc6 12. Nd5 {Results
in a nice position for White}) 11. d4 $1 (11. Bxe6 fxe6 {And now d5 is
unavailable for White knight, and also f-file is opened} 12. d4 exd4 13. Nxd4
Qc8 {And with c5 coming and Nc4 black might as well consider taking the
initiative} 14. Be3 c5 15. Nde2 Nc4 {Okay, Be3 was stupid, but just for
illustration how quickly White's position can go wrong}) 11... Bxa2 12. Rxa2 {
So far the players have been following the game Topalov - Carlsen, GCT Rapid
Paris 2016., but Carlsen is again first to deviate} Re8 {Magnus is prepared.
This move is the first choice of the engines} (12... Nc6 13. d5 {And White was
better, although he eventually lost, Topalov - Carlsen, GCT Raprid Paris 2016.}
) 13. Ra1 {[pgndiagram]The opening phase is over. White has managed to occupy
the centre, but it doesn't bring him much joy. Black's pieces are fully
developed and he has simply a pleasant Ruy Lopez position. Maybe white
shouldn't have hurried with taking the rook back, but played b3 first, to
leave the a5 knight stranded, and maybe keep the possibility of doubling on
the a file after a4 somewhere in the future (however far-fetched this
generalisation is)} Nc4 14. Re1 Rc8 {I am not certain about the purpose of
this move, because Black goes c6 instead of c5 anyway} (14... Nb6 {Was maybe
more useful, in oder not to allow b3 to come with tempo} 15. b3 Nbd7 16. Bb2 c6
{With harmonious position}) 15. h3 (15. b3 Nb6 16. Bb2 Nbd7) 15... h6 {Both
sides are playing useful moves and improving their position} 16. b3 Nb6 17. Bb2
Bf8 18. dxe5 {[pgndiagram]Finally fixing the structure, but i don't see
another active plan for White} (18. Qd2 Nbd7 19. Rad1 c6 {And Black is very
solid, and the position is equal.}) 18... dxe5 19. a4 (19. Qxd8 {The computer
prefers the immediate queen exchange, but it is hard to imagine that White has
anything tangible here}) 19... c6 {Just patient play.} 20. Qxd8 {I don't think
that White can benefit from delaying or avoiding this} (20. Qe2 Qc7) 20...
Rcxd8 21. axb5 axb5 22. Ne2 (22. Na2 {With the Nb4 ideas, and hitting e5
doesn't bring anything} Nfd7 23. Bc3 Ra8 24. Nb4 {And now} f6 {[pgndiagram]And
the pawn is taboo} 25. Nxc6 $4 Rac8) 22... Bb4 (22... Nxe4 {Would have also
most probably end in a draw} 23. Bxe5 Bc5 24. Bd4) 23. Bc3 {There is not much
to comment on really. The game quickly peters to a draw} Bxc3 24. Nxc3 Nbd7 25.
Ra6 Rc8 26. b4 Re6 (26... c5 {Immediately was easier} 27. Nxb5 cxb4 28. Nd6 Re6
) 27. Rb1 c5 28. Rxe6 fxe6 29. Nxb5 cxb4 30. Rxb4 Rxc2 31. Nd6 Rc1+ {And here
the draw was agreed. Maybe Black could have tried the following line.} 32. Kh2

following line.} Rc6 34. Nc4 Nxe4 35. Nfxe5 Nxe5 36. Nxe5 Rc1+ 37. Kh2 Nxf2 38.

1. e4 {The champion "changes hand" after playing the Trompovsky in the first
game. Will he head for Italian game, or face the possibility of another Berlin
endgame.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Magnus played 3...a6 as Black here in game
three.} Nf6 {But Sergey isn't "risking it", and goes for the "currently
unbreachable" Berlin defence, which probably caused multiple spectators to
immediatelly switch to something more interesting. And since Mourinho's team
isn't playing any games today, probability of finding something more
interesting is considerably high.} 4. O-O {A first surprise, i think Magnus
prefered to avoid the endgame with d3.} (4. d3) 4... Nxe4 5. Re1 {And a second
surprise. Instead of exchanging queens and going the endgame, Magnus preferes
to play the symmetrical position resulting from the rook move.} (5. d4 Nd6 6.
Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {Is a position I could probably write a
couple of books about. If I knew anything about it though. I promised myself I
will never play this with either colour. Like Svidler. I guess it means I will
never get chances to play in the World championship match. Like Svidler. :P})
5... Nd6 6. Nxe5 Be7 7. Bf1 Nxe5 8. Rxe5 O-O 9. d4 {[pgndiagram]The tabiya of
the variation. There are three reasonable moves for Black here.} (9. Nc3 {Is
apparently somewhat more drawish} Ne8 (9... Bf6 10. Re2 {Is also possible} b6
11. Re1 Re8 12. Rxe8+ Qxe8 13. d4 {And this is very similar to the game}) 10.
Nd5 Bd6 11. Re2 {This was the first instance of move Re2 appearing on the
board. In the New in Chess Magazine Maxime Vachier Lagrave (further referred
to as MVL) claimed that he discovered this move on a pocket set on a train.
Apparently there is something on trains that inspires creativity in people 
(Yes, another Harry Potter reference).}) 9... Bf6 {The most popular move.
Black's idea is to play Re8 next move and try to go with the knight on f5.} (
9... Ne8 {Is now allowing c4.} 10. c4 {From this position White scores 66%
according to my database.} Bf6 11. Re1 d5 12. cxd5 Qxd5 13. Be3 {And now the
position is no longer simetric.}) (9... b6 {Is interesting, but need more
exploration}) 10. Re2 $5 {The credit for this paradoxical maneouvre goes to
MVL (see above). At first point it looks completely ridiculous. But what is
the point behind it? White anticipates that most action will happen on the
e-file in the future. This move retains the possibility of playing Ra1-Re1 in
the very far future, after developing his queenside completely. Also, in the
case of Re8 White has Bf4 without worrying about d4 pawn. In the 8th game of
the 2013 Chennai match Carlsen played 10 Re1.} b6 {The best reaction to Re2,
in my opinion. Threatening Ba6 forces the rook to move again, since White
doesn't want to exchange light squared bishops immediately.} (10... Nf5 {To
illustrate the idea, consider the following moves} 11. c3 d5 12. Bf4 Be6 13.
Nd2 c6 14. Nf3 Qd7 15. Qd2 Nd6 16. Rae1 {Of course, play of both sides was
sub-optimal (White can probably first grab space on the kingside), but Re2!?
is very interesting idea in the position.}) 11. Re1 Re8 (11... Bb7 $5 {Maybe
was more precise}) 12. Bf4 $1 {[pgndiagram]Excellent move. Because of the move
b6 White can afford to play this developing move without worrying about d4.
That is some very deep 21st century opening subtlety.} Rxe1 13. Qxe1 Qe7 (13...
Bxd4 $4 {Would of course be very hard to expect in the World Championship
match.} 14. Bxd6 {And White wins.} cxd6 (14... Bxb2 {Also doesn't help} 15.
Bxc7 Qf8 16. Nd2 Bxa1 17. Qxa1 {With a won endgame for White}) 15. Qe4 Bxb2 16.
Qxa8) 14. Nc3 Bb7 15. Qxe7 Bxe7 {And for the third time in the match we have a
queenless endgame practically directly out of opening. White has a slight
advantage because his pieces are slightly better coordinated and he has more
space. However, Black doesn't have any weaknesses.} 16. a4 {Gaining more space
and threatening a5} a6 (16... h6 {To demonstrate that a5 is not something
Balck should allow, let's make a random move} 17. a5 {And suddenly it is not
easy for Black to make a move} Ne8 18. Nb5 {[pgndiagram]With unpleasant
pressure} Bd8 19. a6 Bc6 20. Re1 d5 21. Nc3) 17. g3 {I am not certain that
light squared bishop exchange is something White should aim for} (17. Bd3 g6
18. Re1 Bf6 19. Be5 {But probably this is also not much for White} Re8 20. Re3)
17... g5 {Now Black clearly equalizes} 18. Bxd6 Bxd6 19. Bg2 Bxg2 20. Kxg2 f5 {
I've commented the position somewhere around this moment with some Croatian
chessplayers and almost everybody was expecting a very quick draw and
expressing extreme boredom with the match course. I have to admit I even
started writing another lamenting post about how little interesting happens in
the match. Oh how i was wrong} 21. Nd5 Kf7 22. Ne3 Kf6 23. Nc4 Bf8 {
[pgndiagram]The last couple of moves haven't changed the evaluation of
position. The situation is similar a in the first game, where Carlsen's knight
is slightly superior to it's bishop's counterpart, but things should peter to
a draw quickly.} 24. Re1 Rd8 (24... d5 {Karjakin said after the game that he
should have played this immediatelly. And indeed, this makes Black's task
somewhat easier. Karjakin said he didn't consider 25 f4 properly} 25. Ne5 Bd6 {

of the g-file, Black is equal}) 25. f4 $5 gxf4 26. gxf4 b5 {Good move, kicking
the knight and opening the a-file} (26... d5 27. Ne5 Bd6 28. Re3 {[pgndiagram]

also Black should probably equalize.}) 27. axb5 axb5 28. Ne3 c6 29. Kf3 Ra8 30.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {It was expected that this move will appear in the
course of the match. The Italian game was revived recently as a way for e4
player to avoid the Berlin defence.} Bc5 4. O-O {To be honest, I am not
familiar with all the subtleties and move orders in this opening. I think they
avoid early c3 because it allows Black to go d5 fast} (4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6.
O-O d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 {[pgndiagram]Although here White has good results recently}
) 4... Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. a4 d6 7. c3 a6 {The tabiya of the variation. Black
takes a moment to place his bishop to a7. Some time ago I tried analyzing the
Italian game for White, but I was unable to find a clear way to advantage.} 8.
b4 {The computer's first suggestion and one of the moves i looked at during
the aforementioned analysis.} (8. Bg5 {[pgndiagram] I think I have read
something that this pin is not so harmless as it was initially though.} h6 9.
Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 {There were many games where White sacrificed on g5} (10. Nxg5 {
[pgndiagram] And the play is extremely interesting. The computer even prefers
White} hxg5 11. Bxg5 Kg7 12. Nd2 {Whiet plays for the long term compensation.
This position should be examined more deeply before venturing over the board.})
10... g4 11. Nh4 Nh5 {[pgndiagram] Is some sort of modern tabiya which looks a
bit risky for Black, but has been played}) 8... Ba7 9. Re1 {[pgndiagram] I
think that Black meets any move by White with the same typical reaction. Ne7 -
Ng6 - c6} (9. Na3 Ne7 10. Nc2 c6 11. Be3 Ng6 12. Bxa7 Rxa7 13. Bb3 Bg4 14. h3
Bxf3 15. Qxf3 a5 {[pgndiagram] And White is only slightly better. Of course
this variation is only approximate and play of both sides can be improved.})
9... Ne7 $5 {Typical maneovre in the Italian game. Knight heads to g6 where he
defends e5 and possibly jumps to f4} 10. Nbd2 Ng6 11. d4 $5 {[pgndiagram] I
have never considered this move, but it is quite logical. Black has removed
the knight which has influenced the centre, so White uses the opportunity to
advance.} c6 {This is a very cunning move. Black is making a useful move,
while making White to play something sub-optimal.} (11... exd4 {[pgndiagram]
Commentary of the move c6 may become more clear if we consider the position
with immediate exchange} 12. cxd4 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 d5 14. Bd3 dxe4 15. Bxe4 {And
now Black is forced to play c6 anyway} c6 16. b5 {[pgndiagram] The point!
White doesn't play h3 here, but goes for b5, with advantage.}) 12. h3 {
Preventing Bg4} (12. b5 {Can now be strongly met by} d5 13. Bd3 exd4 14. cxd4
Bg4 {[pgndiagram]And Black has equalised} 15. Bb2 Nf4 16. Bf1 dxe4 17. Nxe4
axb5) 12... exd4 (12... d5 {Wasn't that good now} 13. dxe5 $1) (12... Re8 {
[pgndiagram] I am not sure what is White's plan if Black just plays quietly}
13. Bf1 d5 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. exd5 {[pgndiagram] With equality. White's
advanced queenside pawns need care}) 13. cxd4 Nxe4 $6 {This trick is met
really often with the pawn on e4 and bishop on c4 and is worth remembering.
However, I highly doubt it brings Black clear equality in every case.} (13...
d5 14. exd5 cxd5 15. Bf1 Re8 {Seems to me more solid}) 14. Bxf7+ $5 {I quite
like when White players do this in the Bc4 variation of the Modern defence
that I often encounter as Black. However the move in the game lets White with
a better position as well. I think it is better for Black to avoid the Nxe4
altogether in this situation} (14. Nxe4 {[pgndiagram]} d5 15. Bd3 dxe4 16. Bxe4
Be6 17. b5 Bd5 18. bxc6 bxc6 19. Qc2 {[pgndiagram] And White doesn't have much
here either, but at least Black has some weaknesses and it is hard to imagine
that White will suffer as Carlsen did}) 14... Rxf7 15. Nxe4 d5 $1 {[pgndiagram]
This is forced, since else White would play it} (15... h6 16. d5 $1) 16. Nc5 h6
{Preventing Ng5 is always a good idea} 17. Ra3 $1 {A very original way to
include the rook into the game} Bf5 18. Ne5 $6 {Faulty move. Carlsen probably
missed or underestimated Black's 20th move} (18. Rae3 {[pgndiagram] This would
have been a logical continuation of the plan} Qf6 19. Ne5 Rff8 20. Nxg6 Bxg6
21. Qd2 {And here White has only slight lead in development} Rae8 {[pgndiagram]
However, the evaluation is close to equality.}) 18... Nxe5 19. dxe5 {Carlsen
probably thought that this is the only way to play for the win} (19. Rxe5 $5 {
Was interesting again though} Qd6 (19... Bb8 {[pgndiagram] Is risky} 20. Nxb7
Qf6 (20... Qf8 21. Nc5 Bxe5 22. dxe5)) 20. Rg3 Raf8 21. Bf4 Be4 22. Be3 {
[pgndiagram] With somewhat the better chances}) 19... Qh4 $1 {[pgndiagram]A
good move, creating fresh threats on the kingside} 20. Rf3 (20. e6 $2 {Is met
by} Bxe6) 20... Bxc5 $6 {There was no need to hurry and give up the bishop pair
} (20... Bg6 21. Rxf7 Bxf7 {[pgndiagram]}) 21. bxc5 {Now White is again in
control. The structure is similar to game four and b8 is again weak. However,
the position is close to equal due to lack of tangible weakness and opposite
coloured bishops.} Re8 {[pgndiagram]The maneuvering phase of the games ensues}
22. Rf4 Qe7 23. Qd4 Ref8 24. Rf3 Be4 25. Rxf7 Qxf7 26. f3 Bf5 27. Kh2 Be6 {
[pgndiagram] Black is very solid and it is hard for White to create something
serious. His plan should include pushing the kingside pawns, which might leave
his king weakened.} 28. Re2 Qg6 29. Be3 Rf7 30. Rf2 Qb1 31. Rb2 Qf5 32. a5 {
[pgndiagram]I am not sure whether this was neccessary since Black's king is
quite safe now on the queenside} (32. f4 Qh5 33. Rf2 {And trying to go g4 with
the black king on kingside might have been a better plan} Bf5) 32... Kf8 {
Black decides to act first and moves his king to the blocked queenside.} 33.
Qc3 Ke8 34. Rb4 g5 {[pgndiagram] preventing any action on the kingside by the
rook} (34... Kd8 {[pgndiagram]} 35. Rf4 Qg6 36. Rxf7 Qxf7 37. g4 {And the
dissapearence of rooks might be considered an achievement for White.}) 35. Rb2
Kd8 36. Rf2 Kc8 37. Qd4 {[pgndiagram] Objectively the game should end in a
draw. But Carlsen is persistent this time which soon lands him into trouble.}
Qg6 38. g4 $5 {A risky decision before time control. Opening the h file will
benefit Black.} h5 39. Qd2 Rg7 40. Kg3 Rg8 41. Kg2 {[pgndiagram] I am really
not sure about last two moves by White. Kg2 is a blunder, because it blocks
the rook's path to h file, This move was the result of the wrong notation of
the moves. Let me explian. The players receive bonus time after move 40.
Carlsen apparently though that only this is the move 40. Even World Champions
make mistakes as this in time trouble.} hxg4 42. hxg4 d4 $6 {Objectively not a
good move} (42... Qh6 $1 {Seizing the h file, was simple and good for Black}
43. Bd4 Rh8 44. Kf1 Qh1+ 45. Ke2 Qb1 {[pgndiagram]Is highly unpleasant for
White} 46. Qxg5 Rh1 {And I would always rather be Black, especially in
practical game.}) 43. Qxd4 Bd5 $6 {And this is another slip, because it allows
White to counter on h-file} (43... Rh8 {Was mentioned by Karjakin at the press
conference} 44. Qe4 Qh6 45. Kf1 Qh1+ 46. Ke2 Qa1 {[pgndiagram] Karjakin said
he forgot about this move. Again it is very hard to evaluate, and Black has to
play two pawns down. Imagine White king escapes?} 47. Bxg5 {However, I am not
certain Black has that much here. Objectively} Bd5 48. Qf4 $1 {A key move,
preparing Qc1 somewhere in the future.} Qb2+ 49. Ke1 Rh1+ 50. Rf1 Qa1+ 51. Qc1)
44. e6 $1 {Great resource, ruling out Rh8} Qxe6 45. Kg3 {[pgndiagram] White is
still slightly worse, but next Karjakin's move changes that} Qe7 {With this
the last train for pushingtown leaves.} (45... Kb8 46. Qc3 {This is the
computer sugestion. The idea is to put the bishop on e5} (46. Rh2 Ka7 {And
White's position is highly unpleasant. f3 will come under pressure}) 46... Ka7
47. Bd4 Rf8 48. Be5 {[pgndiagram] And Black has nothing. But it is really hard
to judge how would the game unfold}) 46. Rh2 {Now the game quickly peters into
a draw.} Qf7 47. f4 gxf4+ 48. Qxf4 Qe7 49. Rh5 Rf8 50. Rh7 Rxf4 51. Rxe7 Re4 {
The first game in which Karjakin managed to rise his head and obtain serious
chances. Again my match forecast ( I must be really boring by now) turns out
to be correct. Carlsen after missing serious chances in games three in four
tries to "win by force" and almost ends up being punished for it.} 1/2-1/2

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Here we go. Again no Berlin} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O
Be7 6. Re1 {This time Karjakin goes for the "old" main line, without early d3}

d5 $5 {Is a variation}) 9... d6 (9... d5 $5 {Is again possible here, although
with d3 instead of c3 it is favourable for White.}) 10. a3 {[pgndiagram] And
we have still reached something similar to the 2nd game. Black has many
reasonable options. Virtually every move is possible} Qd7 $5 {The 2nd most
popular move. Black connects his rooks and develops further} (10... Na5 11. Ba2
c5 {With typical Ruy play.}) (10... Nb8 {Along the Breyer lines is also
possible} 11. Nbd2) 11. Nbd2 $5 (11. Nc3 {[pgndiagram]My personal opinion is

transfer the knight via that square.} Rfe8 12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. Bxd5 Nd8 14. Bxb7
Nxb7 15. Be3 {[pgndiagram] Although with mass exchanges on d5 it is hard for

15. Qf3 {The typical maneouvre in the Ruy, but Black is well prepared for this}

that I will not even consider other escapades such as c5} 17. dxe4 Nc4 {I
think that it was here where Karjakin misscalculated.} 18. Bxh6 {This would be
a great move, if there wasn't a riposte by Black} Qc6 $1 {[pgndiagram]This is
what Karjakin missed. To my mind this is far from obvious, and i am not sure
how many players would find this.} (18... Nxe4 19. Rxe4 {Karjakin demonstrated
a nice variation here.} f5 $4 (19... Bxe4 20. Qxe4 gxh6 21. Ne3 {Leaves White
better}) 20. Rxc4 $1 {[pgndiagram] And White wins}) 19. Bxc4 $2 {And

20. Ne3 {And nothing terrible for White is apparent} Ned6 {Svidler and Hansen

23. Qg4 Qc6 {But Carlsen's reply is good also}) 22. Rad1 Rab8 23. Bc1 f6 24.
Qxc6 Bxc6 {[pgndiagram] Once again we have a "queenless middlegame". Black's
chances are undoubtly better, his pieces are nice, he has a pair of strong
bishops, and b2 is weak. The plan for Black is to play on both wings, and use
pressure on queenside with push of the pawns in the centre and on the kingside.

still weak.} 32. Rd1 Kf7 {Now the king enters} 33. Rd4 {[pgndiagram]Attacking
c4, but Black has a tactical response It is always pleasant to see how top
level players manage to unite this little combinations with their strategical
goals.} Re5 {Threatening mate} (33... d5 {Would probably easen the grip a
little.}) 34. Kf1 Rd5 35. Rxd5 {Rook exchange is inevitable} (35. Rxc4 Bb5)

result in a draw.}) 39. Be7 Bxh4 {[pgndiagram] This was not strictly
neccessary, but it doesn't spoil anything.} (39... g6 {And again White can
hardly move}) 40. Bxd6 Bd8 41. Ke2 g5 {[pgndiagram] Now the kingside pawn-roll
comes} 42. Nf2 Kg6 $2 {As pointed by user "Eyal" on chessgames, this might be
Magnus' ultimate miss in the game} (42... Bd5 43. g3 g4 $1 {[pgndiagram] And
the knight is dominated} 44. Nd1 Bf3+ 45. Kd2 Bxd1 46. Kxd1 {[pgndiagram] And
now Black must be winning. Even Caruana tweeted about this variation}) 43. g4 {
I would always hesitate to push pawns in such a position, but Karjakin's
active defence manages to confuse Carlsen.} Bb6 44. Be5 (44. gxf5+ Kxf5 45. Nh1

how black's two pawns restrict three white pawns on the queenside)}) 44... a5

The critical moment of the game is reached.} f4 {This was condemned by almost
everyone. Magnus overlooked the possibility of the fortress, as he admitted
that he simply thought he has to breakthrough somehow. He will manage to get
his king on b3, but his bishops are unable to deal with the barricades on the
kingside by themselves.} (45... fxg4 {First, let's consider why taking the
pawn is bad} 46. Ne3 Kh5 47. Bg3 {And again there is a fortress on the board})

to asses it however. This endgame is much more complex then it looks like. I
am not certain whether this wins. White has many options.} 46. Nf2 {
[pgndiagram] Most logical. Just waiting and asking Black what can he do} (46.

1. d4 {In his 2nd White game in a row, Karjakin finally "changes hand" and
gives up the e4 move.} d5 2. c4 c6 {So, the champion has prepared a Slav for
this match.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {In my database there are 14 games where Magnus has
had this position on the board. Last time he play the Slav was 4 years ago at
the Tata Steel Chess tournament 2012.} 4. e3 {This is the move he has
encountered most often. 9 times in 14 games} a6 $5 {[pgndiagram]But i guess
this must have come as a surprise to Karjakin. The last time Magnus played
this was against Ponomariov in Wijk aan Zee 2007. Almost 10 years ago.} 5. Bd3
{I think this is a somewhat rare move. With this move Black instantly
transposes in a position similar to Queen's gambit declined lines, where White
has played e3. I am not entirely certain, but I think that current state of
theory says that e3 variation of the queen's gambit is pretty harmless for
Black.} (5. Nf3 {Is much more popular, after which Black usually goes either 5.
..b5 or 5...Bf5.}) 5... dxc4 6. Bxc4 e6 {[pgndiagram] Black's plan is to play
c5-b5-Bb7 in the next couple of moves. I think that there is no way for White
to stop this and that Black will have no trouble equalizing.} (6... c5 $6 {
Immediate advance would mean a pawn sacrifice} 7. dxc5 Qxd1+ 8. Kxd1) 7. Nf3 c5
8. O-O (8. a4 {[pgndiagram] Is the only way to prevent Black's plan, but a4
move always leaves the b4 square weak.} Nc6 9. O-O cxd4 10. exd4 (10. Nxd4 Bd7)
10... Bb4 {And Black has equalised.}) 8... b5 9. Be2 (9. Bb3 {[pgndiagram]Is
more popular move. The idea is to vacate the e2 square for the queen.} Bb7 10.
Qe2 Nbd7 11. Rd1 {And the line continues.} Qb8 (11... Qc7 12. e4 cxd4 13. Nxd4)
12. e4 cxd4 13. Nxd4 Bd6) 9... Bb7 {[pgndiagram] I think that this position is
not dangerous for Black and that he has equalized.} 10. dxc5 {There is nothing
else useful for White.} (10. b3 {[pgndiagram] Trying to develop the bishop
would be met by the pressure on d4} Nc6 11. Bb2 cxd4 12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. exd4 {
[pgndiagram] And he may only be worse.}) 10... Nc6 $5 {[pgndiagram] Again a
novelty by Carlsen. The champion seems to be excellently prepared.} (10... Qxd1
11. Rxd1 Bxc5 {[pgndiagram] This position should probably be OK for Black as
well, but in recent 2500+ games White has managed to score a couple of
victories.}) 11. Nd2 $6 {Similar maneovre occurs when the Queens are exchanges,
but here it is not so effective.} (11. Qxd8+ {Has a hidden point.} Rxd8 12. b4
$1 {[pgndiagram] It is not easy to find this at board, and moreover, since
even my Stockfish indicates it instantly, it must have been taken into account
by Carlsen in his preparation.} Nxb4 13. a4 Bxc5 14. axb5 axb5 15. Nxb5 O-O {
[pgndiagram] And the liquidation on the queenside leads to an equal endgame})
11... Bxc5 12. Nde4 Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Be7 {[pgndiagram] The opening has finished.
Black has equalized without problems. He has an advantage in development, a
little more space and no weaknesses.} 14. b3 Nb4 15. Bf3 O-O (15... f5 $5 {
[pgndiagram] Was an interesting move to try and fight for advantage} 16. Nd2
Bxf3 17. Nxf3 Qxd1 18. Rxd1 Bf6 19. Nd4 Rc8 {[pgndiagram] And here Black
retains some pressure.}) 16. Ba3 Rc8 $2 {[pgndiagram] But this is a bad move.
It is brave to criticize the World Champion, but this is uncharacteristic for
him. Instead of trying to utilize his slightly better position, he goes for a
position with opposite coloured bishops where he will be a pawn down.} (16...
Bd5 17. Ng3 Bxf3 18. Qxf3 Nd5 {[pgndiagram] Leads to equality}) (16... Rb8 17.
Qxd8 Rfxd8 18. Rfd1 {[pgndiagram] And here also draw is the most probably
result, but only Black can play for the win.}) 17. Nf6+ $1 {[pgndiagram]
Entering the tactical complications favourable for White} Bxf6 18. Bxb7 Bxa1
19. Bxb4 Bf6 (19... Qxd1 {[pgndiagram] After this Black wouldn't have to give
up the pawn. But he would still be somewhat tied up} 20. Rxd1 Rc7 21. Bxf8 Rxb7
22. Bb4 Bf6 23. Rc1 h5 24. Rc8+ Kh7 25. Rc6 Ra7 26. Kf1 {[pgndiagram] But even
in this approximate variation it is hard to imagine that he will lose.}) 20.
Bxf8 Qxd1 21. Rxd1 Rxf8 22. Bxa6 (22. b4 {[pgndiagram] Some comentators on
chessgames recommended this, but it is also doubtful that even here White has
anything.} g5 23. Bxa6 Rb8 24. Kf1 Rb6 25. Bc8 Kf8 {[pgndiagram] And i doubt
that White can win this}) 22... b4 {[pgndiagram] Entering the opposite
coloured bishop position with one pawn less. However, since black's b pawn is
controllin White's two queenside pawns, White is unable to create a passed
pawn.} 23. Rc1 {There is nothing to comment on from here. The draw was soon
agreed.} g6 24. Rc2 Ra8 25. Bd3 Rd8 {[pgndiagram] Black only has to avoid
playing Bc3 which would allow a4 in reply. While the pressure on a pawn exists,
there is nothing to worry about.} 26. Be2 Kf8 27. Kf1 Ra8 28. Bc4 (28. Rc4 {
[pgndiagram] Here Bc3 is possible} Bc3 29. a4 $4 {It is never to late to lose..
} bxa3 30. Rxc3 a2) 28... Rc8 29. Ke2 Ke7 30. f4 h6 31. Kf3 Rc7 32. g4 g5 33.
Ke4 Rc8 {From my point of view, this was the most dull game so far. After once
again displaying great preparation, which hasn't been considered his forte,
Carlsen avoided the most fighting continuations (which is considered his forte)
and satisifed himself with a draw.} 1/2-1/2

1. d4 {After two e4 games, where he gained little against Berlin, and some
advantage with the Giuoco Piano, Carlsen returns to d4.} Nf6 2. Nf3 {No
Trompovsky today} d5 3. e3 {Avoiding the London System, the Torre or anything
similar and going for the Colle system.} (3. c4 dxc4 {c4 is much more common,
but it is a different theme. For instance, it allows the text move, entering
the queen's gambit accepted without early e4}) 3... e6 4. Bd3 c5 5. b3 {
[pgndiagram] Magnus is avoiding c3, and preparing to develop his bishop to b2.}
(5. c3 {Would enter the pure Colle}) 5... Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Bb2 {[pgndiagram]
Both sides have free development and don't confront each other for the moment.
So, this is another typical Magnus opening. The goal is not so much to set
Black immediatey problems, but rather to simply get a game.} b6 {The players
have been following the game Nakamura - Gelfand, London Classic 2013 so far.
Gelfand chose to develop his knight first.} 8. dxc5 {But this is somewhat
unconventional and apparently a novelty, at least according to my database.} (
8. Nbd2 Nc6 9. c4 {[pgndiagram] Is much more common.} Bb7 10. dxc5 {This move
is a computer novelty.Apparently White has to open the long diagonal for the
bishop sooner or later.} bxc5 11. a3 Rb8 12. Re1 {[pgndiagram] And the
computer prefers White.}) 8... Bxc5 {This suprised me a bit. A second move by
the bishop. I am not certain why Karjakin avoided bxc5, maybe to avoid playing
with the hanging pawns.} (8... bxc5 9. c4 Bb7 10. Nbd2 Nc6 11. cxd5 exd5 {
[pgndiagram] But in my position the hanging pawns aren't weak in this
particular position.}) 9. Nbd2 Bb7 {[pgndiagram] Both sides have completed
their development.} 10. Qe2 (10. c4 $5 {Immediately was interesting.} dxc4 {
[pgndiagram] Relieving the tension is not the best for black.} (10... Nbd7) 11.
Nxc4 Nbd7 12. Rc1 {And despite the symmetry, White's pieces are standing
better.}) 10... Nbd7 (10... Nc6 {[pgndiagram] Was an additional possibility
here.} 11. c4 Re8 {Preparing for d4.} 12. Rfd1 d4 13. a3 dxe3 14. fxe3 Qc7 15.
b4 Be7 {[pgndiagram] And White retains a small plus}) 11. c4 $1 (11. e4 {Was
another idea} dxe4 12. Nxe4 Qe7 13. Rad1 {[pgndiagram] And White is hoping to
exploit his queenside pawn majority. But hope springs eternal..}) 11... dxc4 {
Again I am not certain if this was neccessary. Black reaches symmetry, but
White's pieces are slightly better places.} (11... Rc8 12. Rac1 Qe7 13. cxd5
Nxd5 14. Nc4 {[pgndiagram] However, after White exchanges, a similar position
is reached.}) (11... Qe7 12. cxd5 Nxd5) 12. Nxc4 Qe7 13. a3 $5 {Trying to
provoke a weakness.} (13. Rfd1 {[pgndiagram] Normal developing moves are too
routine} Nd5 14. Rac1 Rac8 15. Nd4 Rfd8 16. a3 Bxd4 $1 {[pgndiagram] A good
counterintuitive move in the position. Getting rid of the superfluous bishop
and vacating the c5 square.}) 13... a5 14. Nd4 {Aiming for the b5 square in
the future.} (14. Rfd1 {[pgndiagram] It was also possible to wait a bit.} Rac8
15. Rac1 Rfd8 16. Bb1 Bd5 17. Nd4 Ne4 18. Nb5 Qg5 {[pgndiagram] But again
Black has the play on the kingside}) 14... Rfd8 (14... e5 {Is the computer
suggestion, although it is a bit commital. It is also chasing the knight where
he wants to go} 15. Nb5 e4 16. Bc2 Nd5 17. Rfd1 (17. Qg4 f5) 17... N7f6 {
[pgndiagram] And black has reasonable play here.}) 15. Rfd1 Rac8 (15... e5 {
[pgndiagram] Is not so effective.} 16. Nb5 e4 17. Bc2 Nd5 18. Qg4 {And now
there is no f5, since Black has moved the rook away. This is what it means "to
get a game". These complex positions are very hard to understand.}) 16. Rac1 (
16. Nb5 $5 {[pgndiagram] Commentators on chessgames, and my engine like this
move. White is consistent in his plan and puts his knight on b5} Nf8 {Now this
maneovre is met strongly} 17. b4 $1 {The point} axb4 18. axb4 Bxb4 19. Nxb6 Rc6
20. Nc4 {[pgndiagram] And despite the symmetry, Black's pieces are somewhat
scattered.}) 16... Nf8 17. Qe1 {Somewhat artificial move, but anticipating the
knight g6-h4 route with attack on g2. Therefore, White prepares Bf1 to defend
the weak point.} (17. b4 {Is now bad} axb4 18. axb4 Bxb4 19. Nxb6 Rxc1 {
[pgndiagram] The point. Now black can exchange the rooks, which gives him the
time to play e5-e4} 20. Rxc1 e5 {And suddenly White's pieces are being chased
away.} 21. Nc2 Ba5 22. Na4 {[pgndiagram] And the most pobably outcome is draw.}
(22. Nc4 $4 e4)) 17... Ng6 18. Bf1 Ng4 {[pgndiagram] Suddenly Black's pieces
are getting really close to White's king} 19. Nb5 $6 {The first missjudgement.
White neglects his king's safety.} (19. h3 N4e5 20. Qc3 {[pgndiagram] And
after this not very natural move, the position should be equal}) 19... Bc6 $6 {
Opting for safety first, but Karjakin misses the chance to try for something
more} (19... Qg5 $1 {I am not sure if Karjakin even considered this} 20. h3 {
White's best reaction} N4e5 21. Nxe5 Nxe5 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. Bxe5 Qxe5 24. b4
axb4 25. axb4 Bf8 {[pgndiagram] And in this approximate variation, White can
forget about winning forever}) 20. a4 Bd5 {[pgndiagram] Black won the b4
square at least} (20... Bxb5 $2 21. axb5 {Would only benefit White}) 21. Bd4 {
The tension in the centre is growing, and Karjakin decides to release it.} Bxc4
$6 (21... Bxd4 {[pgndiagram] Was a better exchange} 22. Rxd4 N6e5 23. h3 Bxc4
24. Bxc4 Nf6 {[pgndiagram] With equality.}) 22. Rxc4 Bxd4 23. Rdxd4 $6 {I
don't really understand this move. Carlsen is trying to keep the position
alive, but by creating imbalances in his position he doesn't achieve much, but
merely gives Black some targets.} (23. Rcxd4 {Seems more natural} Rxd4 24. Rxd4
N6e5 25. Qd2 {[pgndiagram] And White is slightly better, but more importantly,
there is absolutely no way he can lose this position.}) 23... Rxc4 24. bxc4 $6
{[pgndiagram] Naturally. Carlsen wasn't going to take with the rook. However,
this is objectively dubious, since White's pawns are quite weak now.} (24. Rxc4
N4e5 25. Rc2 h6 {[pgndiagram] Is dead equal}) 24... Nf6 25. Qd2 Rb8 26. g3 Ne5
27. Bg2 h6 {Making space for the king.} (27... Ned7 28. Na7 Qa3 29. Rxd7 Nxd7
30. Qxd7 {[pgndiagram] And here e3 is covered (see next variations), and
therefore two minor pieces are worth more than a rook.}) 28. f4 $5 {
[pgndiagram] Again being agressive, which doesn't spoil anything yet, though.}
Ned7 29. Na7 Qa3 $1 {This is a great move, and was allowed by White's 28th
move.} 30. Nc6 (30. Rxd7 {[pgndiagram]} Nxd7 31. Qxd7 Qxe3+ 32. Kf1 Qc1+ {
[pgndiagram] And Black has at least perpetual}) 30... Rf8 31. h3 {[pgndiagram]
Getting some "luft", and threatening Rxd7.} Nc5 {Now the a4 is a "gooner".
White has to demonstrate that he has sufficient play for it. Another important
point is that both players had around 6 minutes on the clock at this point.}

Nh5 35. Qf2 g6 36. g4 Ng7 37. Qh4 {Apparently White has enough play here.} Qe3
{[pgndiagram]} (37... Kh7 $6 {[pgndiagram] Would lose the f7 pawn, which I
wouldn't like as black here} 38. Qe7 Re8 (38... Kg8 $4 {Loses} 39. Rd8) 39.
Qxf7) 38. Qxh6 Re8 {With apparent equality.}) 33... g6 34. Qd4 Kg7 $1 {Calmly
walking into a pin, correctly judging that White can't take advantage of that}
35. c5 $2 {[pgndiagram] And this is going over the top} (35. Rd7 {Was still
sufficient to maintan the balance} Qc5 36. Ra7 Qxd4 37. exd4 Nc3 38. Ne5 {
[pgndiagram] And Black is too tied to the defence of the f pawn to push his a
pawn.}) 35... Rxd8 $1 (35... bxc5 {To understand idea behing c5, let's take
with the pawn} 36. Qd6 $1 {[pgndiagram] And White will win} Rxd8 37. Nxd8 {The
f7 cannot be defended} Qxe3 38. Qe7 Nh5 39. Qxf7+ Kh8 40. Qxg6 {[pgndiagram]
And White wins.}) 36. Nxd8 Nxc5 {Now Black is two clear pawns up, and the task
is rather technical. However, in time scramble everything is possible.} 37. Qd6
Qd3 $4 {While I was watching this life, I immediately remembered the game six
of the last Carlsen - Anand match, where Magnus blundered heavily and got away
with it. I couldn't believe that the history is repeating itself again.} (37...
Qa4 {[pgndiagram] Since White's only threat is to attack the f7, Black's move
prevents it} 38. Qxb6 Ncd7 {And from this point on Black is a clear passed
pawn up.}) 38. Nxe6+ $3 {[pgndiagram] Magnus finds this great shot in time
trouble.} fxe6 {Obviously, taking with the knight would lose the queen.} 39.
Qe7+ Kg8 40. Qxf6 {[pgndiagram] The time trouble has ended, and the draw
should have been the result.} a4 41. e4 $1 {This interference move was
probably missed by Karjakin earlier in his calculations. Now g6 falls} Qd7 (
41... a3 42. Qxg6+ Kf8 {[pgndiagram]Would be a draw i guess. If magnus would
have settled for it. He also has the option of continuing} 43. f5 Qd7 (43... a2

Qg5+) 42. Qxg6+ Qg7 43. Qe8+ Qf8 44. Qc6 $6 {[pgndiagram] A risky and
unnecessary decision. Magnus, after weathering the storm, continues to play
for the win. With such a strong passed pawn for Black, and potentially a good
knight, it was rather unneccessary.} (44. Qg6+ {And let's get on with the
match and play the next game.}) 44... Qd8 {Karjakin plays almost flawlessly
from this point on. Eyeing the e7 is good decision} (44... Qb8 $6 {Would
require more creativity.} 45. f5 Kf8 (45... a3 {Is now bad} 46. fxe6 Kg7 47. e7

let White make use of the Black's king weakened position}) 47. e7 $6 (47. Qb5
$1 {[pgndiagram] Is an amazing computer move. The point is that Qb2 comes with
check now.} Nxe6 48. Qb4 Qf8 49. Qxb6 {And if someone has to be careful, that
is certainly Black}) 47... Qxe7 48. Qxb6 Nd3 {[pgndiagram]The knight is going
to block the bishop on e5} 49. Qa5 $2 {I think this is the first critical
moment.} (49. h4 {Activating the bishop immediately, was the last chance} Ne5 (
49... a2 50. Qd4+) 50. Bh3 a2 51. Qb2) 49... Qc5 {Now Black installs the
knight on e5} 50. Qa6 Ne5 {The culminating point of the game and possible of
the entire match.} 51. Qe6 $4 {[pgndiagram]Played after the 5 minutes thought.
Carslen either missed or understimated Black's response.} (51. Qb7+ {Giving
this check is probably the only way to stay in the game.} Nf7 {The only way to
continue for more} (51... Kg6 52. Qa6+ Kh7 53. Qb7+) 52. Qa6 h5 53. h4 Ne5 {
[pgndiagram] And now Black's attack is not that fast compared to the game
continuation} 54. Qb7+ Kf6 55. Qa6+) 51... h5 $3 {[pgndiagram] Played also
rather quickly (after some 5 minutes). To my mind this is an amazing move.
Black simply mates White out of nowhere. With such a weakened king. Kudos to
Karjakin for finding this. This is the only way to finish the game immediately}
52. h4 (52. Qa6 {To understand why this is such a strong move, let's simply
move the White queen away} Qc3 {Threatening Qb2} 53. Qa7+ Kh6 54. Qa6+ Ng6 {

while the a pawn queens.}) 52... a2 $3 {Here Carlsen resigned, after
convincing himself that his position is hopeless.} 53. Qxa2 Ng4+ 54. Kh3 Qg1 {
[pgndiagram] And there is nothing White can do to prevent mate} 55. Bf3 Nf2+ {
What a spectacular and amazing finish of the game. This is the chess on the
highest level.} 1/2-1/2

1. e4 {I like this decision by Karjakin. He doesn't chicken after the victory,
but continues to playing principaly.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {So, for the 3rd
time in the match we have the Closed Ruy Lopez on the board.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O
b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 {[pgndiagram] A new variation. Instead of offering Marshall as
in games 2 and 4, Magnus goes for the Neo - Arkhangelsk variation. I think
that in modern times the move 6...Bc5 is played exclusively instead of the old
6... Bb7. It is curious to see what Garry Kasparov wrote about this in his
"Revolution in the 70s": "Apparently, Malanyuk was the first to conclude that
Black should not hurry with 6... Bb7, and he began emplyoing the improved
variation with 6.. Bc5" I am not versed enough into all the nuances to

there is no definitive answer which one is better yet.}) 14... Nxd4 15. cxd4
Bxf3 16. gxf3 {[pgndiagram] The point of the variation. Black gives his bishop
pair and a pawn. As a compensation he shatters White's kingside structure. To
be honest, I am surprised that Magnus didn't go for Sicilian, or maybe even
French defence, in order to generate more imbalances. Because I think here it
is hard to play for win with Black. But then again, maybe it wasn't neccessary
to go all in with the Black pieces yet.} (16. Qxf3 Bxd4 {Is not advisable, of
course}) 16... Nh5 17. Kh1 Qf6 {Preventing f4} (17... c5 $6 {[pgndiagram] Is

to be honest, Carlsen's opening choice didn't leave him with many
opportunities to go wrong. At least that's my humble 2175 impression} 1/2-1/2

{To be honest, I was anticipating 1 Sf3 at some point by Magnus, as Kasparov
played in the 24th game in the Seville match. But probably Magnus decided that
the "time" for such drastic measures hasn't yet arrived.} 1. e4 e5 {Of course,
there is no reason for Karjakin to deviate from the Berlin} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
Nf6 4. d3 $1 {I think that this is what Carlsen should have played from the
start, as the resulting positions are fully comapatibile with his style.} Bc5
5. c3 {[pgndiagram] For me it is always interesting to discover some nuances
in the move orders. White doesn't want to allow Nd4} (5. O-O Nd4 {Gives Black
this option} 6. Nxd4 Bxd4 7. c3 Bb6 {[pgndiagram] And from this position
Magnus lost his latest long time control game. Carlsen - Aronian, European
teams, 0-1. Probably it was noted by Karjakin's team}) 5... O-O 6. Bg5 $5 {And
this is already very rare.} (6. O-O {Is much more often} d6 7. Bg5 {
[pgndiagram] Most often White players wait for Black to play d6, so there
isn't any Be7 available for Black.}) 6... h6 7. Bh4 {[pgndiagram] It is
interesting to stop and consider this position for a moment.} Be7 {It is
interesting to note that the bishop retreat was Magnus' choice when he faced
this position with Black in Shirov - Carlsen, Biel 2011. Also, here is his
comment: " Once the white bishop is on h4, this loss of tempo is considered to
be justified"} (7... g5 8. Bg3 d6 9. Nbd2 {Is how the game Anand - Topalov,
Wch Saint Louis 2005 proceeded. Topalov managed to neutralize the White pieces,
but probably Karjakin didn't want to commit himself with the kingside pawn
advance so early.}) 8. O-O (8. Nbd2 {Is how the aforementioned game with
Shirov went. Magnus won that encounter as well.} d6 {And White prolonged
castling, but I am not certain about that "subtle" method} 9. Nf1) (8. Bxc6

square.} 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Nc4 $1 {[pgndiagram]I like this way of maneouvering
the knight to e3 while keeping the centre static for the time being.} (11. d4 {
Was too rushed} Nf4 12. Re1 Qf6 {And black gets good counterplay}) 11... Nf4
12. Ne3 Qf6 {[pgndiagram] Maybe somewhat too cautious.} (12... f5 {Without
underestimating anyone, I think that many lower rated players would play this
"natural" move instantly I like it as well, opening the f-file and creating
breathing space for Black's pieces} 13. g3 fxe4 14. dxe4 Nh3+ 15. Kg2 Qf6 {
[pgndiagram] And Black has counterplay} 16. Qe2 Ne7 17. Ng1 $1 Nxg1 18. Rxg1 {
[pgndiagram] And in this computer variation White retains a very slight plus.
But the position is not a dead draw yet.}) 13. g3 $1 {Since white doesn't have
his light squared bishop, this might seem a little risky. But probably sooner
or later he would have to get rid of the strong BLack knight on f4.} Nh3+ 14.
Kh1 $6 {[pgndiagram] But this is indeed a bit too cautious} (14. Kg2 {Was
perfectly possible. Maybe Carlsen feared some Nf4 tactics in the future} Qg6
15. Nh4 Qg5 16. Nef5 {And White is better} Nf4+ 17. Kh1) 14... Ne7 15. Bc4 $6 {
Missing a very nice reply from black.} (15. Qe2 {Was probably better, due to a
deep computer tactic}) 15... c6 (15... b5 {[pgndiagram] While I was following
the game live on chessbomb, the computer screamed for this move to be played.
I didn't quite understand it, but it really isn't that hard} 16. Bb3 (16. Bxb5
Rb8 {Is the point. Black get's his pawn back and activates hsi rook} 17. Bc4
Rxb2 18. Kg2 {[pgndiagram] And Black's activity is worth at least for equality}
) 16... a5 17. a4 b4 {[pgndaigram] And Black has seized some space on the
queenside}) 16. Bb3 $1 {The idea of this move is to sidestep the d5 advance in
the future} (16. a4 $5 {Preventing queenside expansion once and for all, but
allowing the centre break}) (16. d4 {[pgndiagram] Was once again too fast} exd4
17. cxd4 Re8 18. e5 dxe5 19. dxe5 Qg6 {[pgndiagram] And Qe4 is anoying threat}
20. Nh4 Qe4+ 21. Qf3 Qxf3+ 22. Nxf3 {[pgndiagram] Balck is probably even
slightly better here}) 16... Ng6 {Both sides are maneouvering for the moment}
17. Qe2 a5 18. a4 Be6 $1 {[pgndiagram] A good move and a critical moment of
the early part of the game.} 19. Bxe6 $2 {Probably it is too harsh to
accompany this move with a question mark, but it could have led to a forced
draw. Which would be terrible result for Magnus at this stage of the match.} (
19. Bc2 {[pgndiagram] First of all, this simple bishop retreat would have kept
the game going} d5 {The logical continuation of Black's game.} 20. d4 dxe4 21.
Bxe4 Rae8 {[pgndiagram] And White is probably slightly better here. And more
importantly, a complicated struggle follows}) (19. Ra3 {[pgndiagram] Secondly,
the maneovre of the rook was the suggestion of both the engine and the
Gustafsson - Svidler commentating duo} Bxb3 20. Rxb3 Rab8 21. Nd2 {And White
is much better. Black probably shouldn't exchange on b3}) (19. Nd2 {
[pgndiagram] Finally, this is the move that Wesley so claims is the best in
the position} Bxb3 20. Nxb3 Rfe8 21. Rae1 {And once again White has good
prospects, Black has to be careful about the a-pawn and White will probably
advance in the centre sooner or later}) 19... fxe6 20. Nd2 {[pgndiagram] The
first critical moment} d5 $2 {Missing a very nice tactic and indicating that
nerves are also taking its toll on the challenger, and not just the champion} (
20... Nxf2+ $1 {[pgndiagram] This move is perfectly possible, as it would
either lead to a draw, or to a position where White would be "playing with
fire" if he was to continue.} 21. Kg1 {The only way to continue} (21. Kg2 {
Would run into} Nh4+ 22. Kg1 {The knight cannot be taken} (22. gxh4 $2 Qg6+ {
[pgndiagram] And Black is winning} 23. Ng4 Nxg4) 22... Nh3+ {With perpetual
check}) 21... Nh3+ 22. Kg2 Nhf4+ $1 {[pgndiagram] Karjakin said that he missed
this move in his preliminary calculations} 23. gxf4 Nxf4+ 24. Rxf4 exf4 25. Nc2
{[pgndiagram] And I think there is no doubt that Black shouldn't be worse here.
Of course, White has some practical chances, but I think that Carlsen wouldn't
risk this much at this point and would settle for a draw earlier.}) 21. Qh5 $2
{This time it is Carlsen's turn to go wrong and allow the challenger another
opportunity to draw the game immediately} (21. f3 $1 {Was very solid and much
more in Carlsen's style. From this point White can gradually improve his
position}) 21... Ng5 $2 {[%emt 0:00:20] Missing the chance to force a draw
once again. But too be honest this one was much harder to see than the one on
move} (21... Nxf2+ {[pgndiagram] Is perfectly viable here. However, the follow
up is not that obvious} 22. Kg2 {The only move} (22. Kg1 $2 {Is faulty due to
a knight fork tactic} Qg5 23. Qxg5 Nh3+ {[pgndiagram] And Black remains a
healthy pawn ahead}) 22... Qf7 {Threatening Nf4+ or Nh4 check} 23. Kg1 {And
now the key move is} Qf6 {[pgndiagram] While commentating live Peter Svidler
said that it is very hard to consider such a paradoxical computer move during
the preliminary calculations. Black simply threatens Qg5 and Nh3 again, and
there is no good way for white to avoid that}) 22. h4 $6 {Sometimes chess is
amazing. Instead of this obvious move, white had one much subtler} (22. Rae1 {
This was Svidler's find during the live feed (bear in mind that he was
analysing without the engine). The point ill be revealed soon} Nf3 23. Ng4 {
And now black must play Qg5 and play inferior endgame, because} Qf7 24. Nxf3
Qxf3+ 25. Kg1 Ne7 26. Re3 {[pgndiagram] And amazingly, Black's queen is trapped
}) 22... Nf3 23. Nxf3 Qxf3+ 24. Qxf3 Rxf3 {[pgndiagram] The crisis is over.
White has managed to get another position where play is "only on one goal".
Doubled e-pawns are a constant headache} 25. Kg2 Rf7 (25... Raf8 26. h5 Ne7 {
[pgndiagram] And now White can almost always win the exchange} 27. Nf5 (27.
Rad1 {With Nf5 or Ng4 next is probably eeven more precise}) 27... exf5 28. Kxf3
fxe4+ 29. Ke2 exd3+ 30. Kxd3 {[pgndiagram] And White is probably close to
winning, although a technical task still remains}) 26. Rfe1 $6 {Another slight
oversight} (26. Ng4 h5 27. Nh2 {Was probably better} Raf8 28. b4) 26... h5 $6 {
And again returning the favour} (26... Raf8 {[pgndiagram] Would earn some time,
because White would have to deal with the threat to the f-pawn} 27. Nd1 (27.
Re2 {Which is what Magnus probably planned, would enter into tactical counter}
dxe4 {I think that if Black plans to go Nf4, he should first exchange on e4.
The reason will be soon apparent} (27... Nf4+ {[pgndiagram] However, here the
machine finds the strong counter, so therefore taking on e4 is probably better}
28. gxf4 exf4 29. Nf5 $1 exf5 30. exd5 cxd5 31. Kf3) 28. dxe4 Nf4+ {
[pgndiagram] Now this works, since Black won't have the weakness on d5 after
Nf5} 29. gxf4 exf4 30. Nf5 exf5 31. e5 g5) 27... d4 28. Ra3 {And Black's
position is better than after what happened in the game}) 27. Nf1 {[pgndiagram]
Now everything is in order once again. White has alot of ideas. He can play
both in the centre with d4 and on the queenside with b4, when favourable
circumstances arive. More importantly, Black doesn't have any active
counterplay} Kf8 (27... Raf8 {Would only prolong, but not hinder White's plan}
28. Re2 Rf3 29. Ne3 R3f7 30. Nc2) 28. Nd2 Ke7 29. Re2 {[pgndiagram] There is
no reason to hurry I think} (29. Rab1 {Is something computer wants to do} Kd6

variation you can see that Black is very much on the defensive}) (29. Nf3 $2 {

punches come} 32. Rae1 {White is probing the e-pawn} Rfe8 {And Black defends}

be too slow} (33... Nf8 $5 {[pgndiagram] Is interesting, but to Black still
has problems} 34. b4 $1 {Emphasizing that Black has weaknesses both in the
centre and on the queenside} Nd7 35. bxa5 Ra8 {The critical moment} (35... Nc5

possible of course} axb4 {There is nothing better though} (34... Nf7 35. bxa5

inferior version of the endgame. e5-d4 probably shouldn't be allowed}) 36...

problem} Ke6 39. exd5+ cxd5 40. Nc1 Nf7 41. Ne2 {[pgndiagram] And Nf4 threat
is very dangerous} Kd6 42. Red3) 37. e5+ Kd7 38. Rf3 $6 {[pgndiagram] Again b4
was possible immediately, but Carlsen first wants to probe the g6 weakness.
However, this gives Black a chance to play actively for the first time} (38. b4

Natural and uncommital move, heading for the f-pawn, but nevertheless not the
best} (38... c5 {Setting the queenside pawns in the motion and grabbing some
space was good. White would have to forget about b4 forever} 39. Nb3 b6 40. Rf6

ideal pawn construction. Black is confined to back two ranks} Nf5 44. Nb3 {

not arrived for that yet, though} Kc7 45. Nc5 {[pgndiagram] Weasley So was
very critical of this move} (45. Rc1 {So claimed that this would win for White.

enormous significance, both for this match and for the chess history.
Exploiting the drawing chance on move 20 would put Carlsen in a desperate
situation, where he would have only two more games to save his title. However,
"fortune" follows the brave, and Magnus probably deserved to have at least
equal score at this point of the match. It will be interesting to follow the
two remaining games, since Magnus will probably get huge psychological boost
because of this result.} 1-0

{In the last White game of the regular part of the World Championship,
Karjakin sticks to his main move.} 1. e4 e5 {Naturally, Carlsen also replies
with what he knows the best.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {And for the 4th time in
the match Carlsen says no to Berlin.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 {[pgndiagram]
Repeating the Closed Ruy Lopez from the games 2 and 4 and 6.} (5... b5 {In the
9th game Carlsen deviated and played the Neo-Arkhangelsk variation} 6. Bb3 Bc5
{But he experienced serious problems in that game}) 6. d3 {Karjakin once again
avoids the Marshall counterattack} b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. a3 {Repeating the variation
from the 2nd game.} O-O 9. Nc3 {So far everything as in game two. Karjakin
obviously had some idea in mind. However, Carlsen once again forestalls him
and deviates first.} Be6 $5 {[pgndiagram] A nice idea. Black offers a bishop
exchange which would ruin his pawn structure. But because of his mobility in
the centre and control of d5, he judges that it is not disadvantageous for him}
(9... Na5 {Would be repetition of game two}) 10. Nd5 $5 {A typical idea. White
refuses to go along with Black's plans, but jumps on the d5 square while it is
available} (10. Bxe6 fxe6 11. Bd2 d5 {Is apparently ok for Black}) 10... Nd4 $1
{Carlsen played this instantly. This move forced the exchange on d4, leaving
Black with a mobile pawn chain on the queenside. The player who played this
relieveing move most often was Peter Svidler. There are 3 games from 2013 year
in my database where Svidler plays Black in this position.} (10... Bxd5 {Is
not a good idea} 11. exd5 Na5 12. Ba2 {And White is simply better}) (10... Na5

Nothing else really brings any advantage} (11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 12. Nxd4 exd4 13. Bg5

Svidler, Thessaloniki, 2013}) 11... exd4 12. Nxf6+ (12. Nxe7+ {[%emt 0:00:11]
Would leave to variations examined after  Nxe7}) 12... Bxf6 13. Bxe6 fxe6 {
[pgndiagram] It is time to pause and evaluate the result of the opening. Black
has a doubled pawn on the d-file, but it is hard for White to attack it or to
play against it. Furthermore, after the potential d5 in the future it is easy
to get rid of that "weakness" On the other hand, White has a kingside pawn
majority. So he will play on that wing.} 14. f4 {Making a useful move while
keeping his queen on the starting square for the moment and retaining the
option of the quick g4 push} (14. a4 {[pgndiagram] Both Anand and Dominguez
Perez played this move against Svidler in the 2013} Qd7 (14... c5 {Was
Svidler's choice against Anand} 15. Qg4 Qd7 16. axb5 axb5 17. Bd2 {And he
immediately equalized}) 15. b3 c5 16. Qg4 Qf7 (16... b4 $5 {Is a possible
improvement}) 17. Bd2 c4) 14... c5 {[pgndiagram] Apparently a novelty of the
game. Black creates a "triangle" in the centre, and has ideas about pushing
further in the future.} (14... e5 {Is another idea} 15. f5 d5 16. Qe2 c5 17. g4
c4 {And Black's counterplay on the queenside probably balances White's push on
the kingside}) 15. Qg4 {[pgndiagram]Typical move for this variation} (15. Rf3 {
Is now met by} d5 16. e5 Be7 17. Rh3 g6 {And White' attack is nonexistent})
15... Qd7 16. f5 $6 {I think this is creating tension too early. White is not
sufficiently developed} (16. Bd2 Rf7 17. b3 Raf8 {Shouldn't pose Black much
problems either, though. It seems like whole variation is relatively harmless})
16... Rae8 {[pgndiagram] Black had sevelar ways of reaching equality} (16...
exf5 17. Rxf5 Rf7 18. Bd2 Be5 {Is probably most clear cut way to equality}) (
16... e5 $5 {Is also a possibility}) 17. Bd2 {Finally completing the
development. Karjakin prefers to keep the tension in the centre for the time
being} (17. fxe6 Qxe6 18. Qxe6+ Rxe6 19. Bd2 Be5 {Is equal}) (17. a4 d5 18.
axb5 axb5 {And Black has no problemos}) 17... c4 $5 {[pgndiagram] Sharpening
the play. Magnus sets his queenside pawns in the motion} (17... exf5 {Was once
again easy path to equality} 18. Rxf5 Rf7 19. Raf1 Be5) 18. h3 $6 {This is
probably a bit too slow in a position like this. White's idea is to defend the
queen and prepare the future h3-g4} (18. fxe6 Qxe6 19. Qxe6+ Rxe6 20. Bb4 Rd8
21. Rf5 {Is probably equal as well, though}) 18... c3 $5 {[pgndiagram] Trying
to set concrete problems for White.} (18... e5 $5 {Was another interesting
idea. Trying to close the centre in order to play on the queenside.} 19. Qf3
Rc8 20. g4 h6 21. Rac1 cxd3 22. cxd3 Qf7 {And after this approximate variation
Black should be slightly better. White's attack on the queenside is long in
coming}) 19. bxc3 d5 $1 {Carlsen probably prepared this move already when
considering 18...c3!?. It came as clear surprise to Karjakin, who now had to
consider multiple options and captures.} 20. Bg5 {Karjakin choses a save path}

problems} Qxe6 21. Qxe6+ Rxe6 22. exd5 Re2 23. Rf2 Rxf2 24. Kxf2 Bg5+ 25. Ke2

move. It leads to same variation as immediate capture on f5, but it is really
beautiful. To be honest I haven't seen mentioned by either GM Hess in his
chesscom analysis, or by GM So in his chessbase analysis.} (20... exf5 21. Qf3

lost anyway and gets rid of it right away.} dxe4 $1 {The only move for Black
that doesn't land him into a worse position} (20... bxc4 {Is now bad} 21. Bb4

reckon with Qd2 ideas} 29. Qc6 $1 {Precise defence that soon leads to

fantastic move. After ganging his pieces on the kingside, Carslen changes
direction and makes a pawn move on the other side of the board.} 23. axb5 (23.
bxa5 {Was inferior} Rxa5 24. Ra2 {There is nothing better really} bxa4 25. Rxa4
Rxa4 26. Bxa4 Nxd5) 23... axb4 24. Bd2 {A nice calm move} (24. Rxa8 Rxa8 25.
cxb4 Nd4 {And White's pawn structure is in ruins, while Black will regain his
pawn soon after the capture on b5.}) 24... bxc3 25. Bxc3 {[pgndiagram] After
White's precise replies Black still has a slight edge} Ne3 {Perhaps this was a
bit too quick.} (25... Bg3 {Was a possibility here} 26. Rxa8 {White has to be
precise} (26. hxg3 $2 {Is probably not advisable} fxg3 {And White is living on
the edge} 27. Rxa8 Rxa8 28. Ra1 Rxa1+ 29. Bxa1 Qh6 {And he will most probably
have to give back the piece on g3}) 26... Rxa8 27. Ra1 Rxa1+ 28. Bxa1 Nxe4 29.
dxe4 Qh5 30. h3 Ne3 {And at the end, Black still has some slight advantage})
26. Rfc1 Rxa1 27. Rxa1 Qe8 {[pgndiagram] Striking the b5} 28. Bc4 Kh8 {Moving
out of the way, so that the knight is not pinned once it captures on d5} (28...
Nfxd5 {Is too hasty} 29. Qa2 Qf7 {And Black doesn't have an advantage}) 29.
Nxf6 {Removing the threat to the d5 pawn in the more radical way.} (29. Qa2 {
Defending the d5 pawn was another possibility} Qg6 {Black can continue to play
for compensation} 30. Kh1 Rb8) 29... Bxf6 $5 {[pgndiagram] According to the
computer this is not the best move. But I think that this is the move that won
Carlsen.. the match.} (29... gxf6 {Opening the g-file, with the pressure on g2,
is better from the chess truth perspective} 30. Kh1 {This is suboptimal move,
but I think it is instructive to see how precise White has to be. He probably
has to find the series of only moves.} (30. Bd2 {Is the best chance} Nc2 31.
Ra7 Nd4 32. Qf1 Nxb5 {Although even here Black has serious winning chances})
30... Rg8 31. Rg1 Bg3 {And Black is winning}) 30. Ra3 {Defending the bishop} e4
$3 {[pgndiagram] To my mind this is an amazing move. Such a pawn breakthrough
is surely unpleasant to face when already low on time. Black simply gives up a
pawn for a complete Black square domination. Objectively position is still
equal, but now White has to find some precise move in order not to lose, while
Black is hardly risking anything.} 31. dxe4 Bxc3 32. Rxc3 Qe5 {[pgndiagram]
The difference in activity of the pieces compensates for the material deficit.}
33. Rc1 $6 (33. Qd2 {Was probably easier} Ra8 34. Bf1 Ra1 35. Rc1 h6 {And the
position is probably equal}) 33... Ra8 34. h3 $6 {Karjakin makes the most
obvious moves} (34. Qd2 Ra1 35. Bf1 g5 {And Black can play forever, but
White's position shouldn't be breachable}) 34... h6 35. Kh2 Qd4 36. Qe1 $6 {
[pgndiagram] And only this can be called a mistake. Because after this move
White's defensive task becomes much more hard} (36. Bd3 Ra1 37. Rxa1 Qxa1 38.
Qd2 {And White is very much in the game}) 36... Qb2 {Now it suddenly gets very
unpleasant.} 37. Bf1 Ra2 38. Rxc7 $4 {[pgndiagram] And White cracks under the
tension and commits a decisive blunder.} (38. Rb1 {Was now aboslutely
neccessary.} Qf6 {The idea is to go Qg5 next. White has to find only moves to
survive.} 39. Be2 {Even Peter Svidler in his commentary said that this
self-pinning move is very hard to find over the board. Especially in a rapid
game}) 38... Ra1 {And suddenly it is game over as White loses material.} 0-1

1. e4 {It seems like the number of 1 e4 games in this match confirms the
Fischer's evaluation of that move : "Best by test!"} c5 {Of course! When you
need to win a game, Sicilian is the most logical choice.} 2. Nf3 d6 {"Najdorf,
please?"} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3 {[pgndiagram] And you will have none of
that. This variation is the so-called Prins Variation. It occurs here and
there on the highest level, but the main thing is that it is hardly a serious
winning try if Black is content with a draw.} e5 {This move I like to see when
playing e5} (5... e6 {Since my good friend and co-author of this blog, FM
Matej Blazeka has showed me this opening, I have been using it regularly with
decent results. Therefore, I hate the variation with e6 much more. I think
that going for the fast d5 is the best thing Black can do, since it will make
the f3 pawn look plain stupid} 6. c4 Be7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be3 Nc6 9. Be2 d5 {
[pgndiagram] And Black has equalized} 10. exd5 exd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. cxd5) 6.
Nb3 Be7 {[pgndiagram]} (6... a5 {Too be honest, if Black wants to play with a5,
it makes more sense to do so immediately. The point is that White can't go for
Maroczy bind now} 7. c4 $2 (7. Nc3 {Is the correct approach}) 7... Nxe4 $1 {
[pgndiagram]} 8. fxe4 Qh4+ 9. Kd2 a4 {And White's knight has no retreat
squares available}) (6... d5 {Is another theme} 7. Bg5 Be6 8. Bxf6 gxf6 9. exd5
Qxd5 10. Qxd5 Bxd5 11. Nc3 {And in this endgame only White can play for the
win, although the majority of games end up as a draw.}) 7. c4 a5 8. Be3 {
[pgndiagram] I think that White simply gets a good version of the Maroczy now}
a4 9. Nc1 {Such "ugly" knight maneovres are typical of the entire variation.}
O-O 10. Nc3 Qa5 11. Qd2 Na6 $6 {[pgndiagram] Not the best.} (11... Be6 12. Be2
Rc8 {Pressuring the c4 square, wuld have forced a concession from White}) 12.
Be2 Nc5 13. O-O {[pgndiagram] White has a very pleasant position, he has
succesfully carried out all the main ideas of the system without being
hindered.} Bd7 14. Rb1 {The b4 plan is very logical, disrupting the piece
omposition on the queenside.} Rfc8 15. b4 axb3 16. axb3 {It is clear that
Karjakin's had an off day and that he can hardly expect to win this game.} Qd8
17. Nd3 {[pgndiagram]The best way of disturbing Black's best piece, the knight
on c5} (17. b4 Na4 {Was a bit too hasty. The White's knight would ideally like
to use b4 as a jumping point.}) 17... Ne6 18. Nb4 {[pgndiagram] Seizing
control of the d5 square} Bc6 (18... Nf4 {Is computer's first choice. Such a
recommendation by the engine is a clear sign that Black's position is dubious}
19. Bxf4 Qb6+ 20. Be3 Qxb4 21. Rfd1 {And White is still smooth sailing}) 19.
Rfd1 {[pgndiagram] Black simply doesn't have a single active idea} h5 {This is
a bit of desperation} (19... Nd4 $1 {Was not a bad chance} 20. Bxd4 exd4 21.
Qxd4 d5 $1 22. Nxc6 (22. Nbxd5 $2 Bxd5 23. Nxd5 $2 Bc5 {Loses the queen}) 22...
Rxc6 23. b4 {And White remains in control}) 20. Bf1 {[pgndiagram] Carlsen
plays rather safe and slow, occupation of the d5 was perfectly possible,} h4
21. Qf2 {Again ignoring d5} (21. Nbd5) 21... Nd7 22. g3 {This was perhaps also
unnecessary. White plans to play the bishop on h3, but this gives Black time
to latch on some ideas.} (22. Kh1) (22. Rd2) 22... Ra3 (22... Bg5 {Was
apparently the best. Usualy in this structure it is favourable to exchange the
dark squared bishops for black} 23. Rxd6 $2 {Taking the pawn is very bad idea.}
Bxe3 24. Qxe3 Qe7 {And Black suddenly breaths}) 23. Bh3 Rca8 24. Nc2 {
[pgndiagram] The White knights are doing a wonderful job in keeping the black
rooks out} R3a6 25. Nb4 Ra5 {Naturally, there will be no repetition} 26. Nc2 (
26. f4 {Was very interesting, but rather unnecessary in the given match
situation} hxg3 27. hxg3 exf4 28. gxf4 Rh5 {And suddenly play is much more
concrete and tactical than it was a couple of moves ago}) 26... b6 (26... R5a6
{Is objectively the best, but of course, Karjakin couldn't agree to a draw in
this game}) 27. Rd2 Qc7 28. Rbd1 {[pgndiagram] White is probably close to
winning at this point} Bf8 29. gxh4 {Simplifying the position and gaining a
pawn in the process.} Nf4 30. Bxf4 exf4 31. Bxd7 Qxd7 32. Nb4 {[pgndiagram]} (
32. Qxb6 {Was perfectly possible}) 32... Ra3 33. Nxc6 Qxc6 34. Nb5 {
[pgndiagram] The classic example of the -good knight vs bad bishop} Rxb3 {
Karjakin tries to mix things up with an exchange sacrifice, and practically
speaking it is not a bad decision. The problem is that both Carlsen and his
position are too strong.} (34... Ra1 {Trying for the d5 break, was interesting}
35. Kh1 {And that is the end of the demonstration} (35. Kg2 d5)) (34... d5 {
Immediately doesn't work} 35. Nxa3 Bc5 36. Rd4) 35. Nd4 Qxc4 36. Nxb3 Qxb3 {
[pgndiagram] Here White should be technically winning. Moreover, Karjakin was
already below two minutes ata this point} 37. Qe2 Be7 38. Kg2 Qe6 39. h5 Ra3
40. Rd3 Ra2 41. R3d2 Ra3 42. Rd3 Ra7 {[pgndiagram] Naturally, under normal
circumstances Karjakin would have agreed to draw without hesitation. However,
under normal circumstances Magnus would have never offered a repetition in
this position} 43. Rd5 Rc7 44. Qd2 Qf6 45. Rf5 Qh4 46. Rc1 Ra7 47. Qxf4 {Now
soon comes the explosive finish} Ra2+ 48. Kh1 Qf2 {At this point almost
everyone was expecting Magnus tu go for Qg3 and play it safe. But he finishes
the game and the match in style.} 49. Rc8+ $3 {[pgndiagram] Not that hard to
see, but still, choosing a stylish instead of a safe continuation requires
some nerves and bravery.} Kh7 (49... Bf8 50. Rxf8+ Kxf8 51. Rxf7+) 50. Qh6+ $3
{One of the most beautiful checkmate pictures I have ever seen. Even more
beuatiful when the importance of the game and the identity of the opponent are
considered. Not a bad present for your 26th birthday.} 1-0
