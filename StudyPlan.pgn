{As I remember, this was a special tournament organized to \"test\" Alexandru
Crisan, who had a very high rating but was accused of buying rating points. He
didn't pass the test and hasn't played since. It must have been very nice when
chess cheating involved only back-room dealing between conspiring parties,
rather than the current form, which is an elemental attack on the game itself

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 {In general, this move doesn't fit well with 1.d4. The reason
is that it fails to place maximum pressure on the important d5-square, and it
also doesn't do anything for the eventual freedom of white's Rooks. Far more
common is 2.c4 (gaining central and queenside space) when 3.Nc3 will join with
the c4-pawn to pressure d5, while also setting up situations where &amp;ndash;
if Black plays ...d7-d5 at some point &amp;ndash; White will chop on d5 (cxd5)
and open up the c-file for his Rooks. Nevertheless, 2.Nc3 has its supporters
&amp;ndash; the early Knight move forces black's hand (...d7-d5), otherwise
White will play e2-e4 and grab the center. This often leads to sharp, unusual
play, and can easily take Black out of all his opening preparation.} 2... d5

removes black's Bishop pair and, by simplifying, takes away any dynamism that
might have remained in the black position. My old friend grandmaster Nigel
Davies (we shared some interesting adventures in the jungles of Brazil
&amp;ndash; these included an attack on the Mayor's house, me pretending to be a
cop and demanding entrance [by kicking in a door] to a well known grandmaster's
hotel room, an insane Hitler mime that kept sneaking up on the players and
freaking everyone out, and a stampede of coatimundis at Iguazu Falls), in his
book, THE VERESOV (2003), had this to say: \"Black's best plan is to retreat his
Bishop from f5 to e6, play ...f6-f5, and then bring his Knight from b8-e4 via d7
and f6.\"} 7. Qxd3 {The fact is this position is a little better for White, with
the caveat that Black's ideal result is a draw, while White will be pushing for
more throughout the game. In other words, it's an ideal grandmaster opening that
offers White chances to win, and few chances to lose. Why is this the case? The
pawn structure answers that question: white's structure is devoid of weaknesses
and offers two key pawn breaks &amp;ndash; c2-c4 or e3-e4. Black's structure is
less flexible and lacks the same type of fluid breaks since ...c6-c5 would leave
d5 weak, and ...f6-f5-f4 is very difficult to achieve. Other than these basic
positional ideas, if Black castles short, White can also go for the kingside
nuke option via g2-g4, h2-h4, etc. Thus, for the most part black's position is
passive, and he'll usually just hold tight and hope to earn that half a point.}
7... Bd6 (7... Bb4 {is also commonly seen, which stops White from playing a
quick e3-e4.}) 8. e4 {This move, which scores very well for White, seeks to
create a favorable pawn structure in one of two ways: 1) Black will leave the
pawn on e4 and let White take on d5. The resulting isolated pawn on d5 will
prove rather weak; 2) Black will capture on e4, which will result in positions
where White is half a pawn ahead (black's crippled kingside majority won't be
able to create a passed pawn in most endgames). In this 2nd scenario, Black
isn't badly placed, but he will face a long, thankless defensive task. And, as I
said earlier, if black's successful, he'll get no more than a draw.} 8... dxe4

identical to positions Ulf Andersson got in the 70s. In fact, the Black side of
this structure was his bread and butter and he rarely lost against world-class
opposition! If you or anyone else wants to play this line vs. the Verasov, you
need to make a detailed study of that structure and then you can enter these
lines with confidence. Actually, this is how you should study all openings:
master the pawn structures, understand the pros and cons of those structures,
and only then memorize some moves (they will make a lot more sense after you
\"grok\" the structures).} (12... Na6 13. Ne2 Bc7 14. d5 cxd5 15. Rxd5 O-O 16.

an eye on two important squares (c5 and e5) so I'm not sure White should rush to

some mistakes to lose the game, so he doesn't rush &ndash; instead he quietly
builds his position, seeks ideal positions for his Knights, and hopes Black
cracks due to the strain of having to constantly defend. As you can see, the
experienced (and strong) player knows very well that one-move threats literally
force the opponent to be on his guard, and that the resulting heightened sense
of danger usually results in good moves. Thus, instead of forcing the issue,
White patiently keeps improving his position and follows this classic old rule:

to weaken himself) by the pin?} 4... h6 {It was long considered that Black
should take the opportunity to chase the bishop to h4, but nowadays many players
avoid this move in order to try to exploit the position of the bishop tactically
(by a ...Ne4 move, for instance).} 5. Bh4 c5 {It is logical and practically
necessary to attack the center this way, emphasizing the bishop's absense from
the queenside. Otherwise, White plans a setup with e3, Bd3 and Nge2 - an ideal
position.} 6. d5 {This irruptive move is typical of the variation.} 6... exd5

pawn sacrifice 7...b5!?.} (6... Bxc3+ {Black often makes this capture without
provocation in this line, since it is in danger of being left out of the game

trades it off, although it was possible to play other moves.} 16. bxc3 Qh4 {It
looks like a good kind of Benoni (at least the central structure), where Black
has traded some pieces and has no weakness of the kingside. However, looking
closer you see that Black lacks the usual counterplay while White's central
pawns can become a dangerous force.} 17. f4 $1 Ng4 18. Bxg4 Bxg4 {Better than
18...Qxg4, after which the ending would be worse for Black. But after White's
next move, Black's pieces prove to be awkward as well.} 19. Qa4 $1 {White
creates some unpleasant threats on the fourth rank - for instance, f4-f5,
creating a strong pin. Meanwhile, White prevents the bishop from going to its
most natural square on d7.} 19... Bc8 20. e4 {The pawns storm forward. Black
faces a difficult defense. Additionally, in this position the knight is stronger
than the bishop.} 20... Qg4 21. Qc2 h5 $1 {Smyslov fights back with resolve. The
advance of the h-pawn will mean that at least White doesn't have an easy life.}

same.} 23. e5 h4 24. Nf1 {The knight couldn't go to e4 due to the pin 24...Bf5.

is holding, but he must walk on a tightrope. This move, however, is
capitulation, allowing the opening of the f-file. Black had to play something
like 25...Rfe8.} (25... Rfe8 26. Re1 Qg6 {Black will have to continue to step
lightly, but he has reasonable chances of defending.}) 26. fxe5 Bg6 {The threat
was 27.Ne3 (which was not as big a threat when the f-file was closed). But now
the bishop is out of the fight against White's center pawns.} 27. Re1 h3 28. d6

in, with an immediate threat of 32.Ne7+ followed by 33.Rh4+.} 31... Rfe8 {Black
will be more than happy to capture the knight if it goes to e7. If instead
31...g6, then the clearest win is 32.Rh4!, meeting 32...gxf5 (or 32...Qxf5

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 c5 {Not a common move, but logical in a way.
Black transforms the game into a Benoni with the inclusion of a3 and ...b6.
There are indeed quite a few lines of the Benoni where ...b6 is a useful move,
while White usually ends up playing a4, not a3. Nevetheless, White can try to
aim for lines where this difference is not relevent, and also try to show that
even an improved Benoni is still not good enough...} 5. d5 exd5 6. cxd5 g6 7.
Nc3 Bg7 {It is worth thinking about playing the more normal 7...d6, when 8.Bg5
can be met in the normal way, by 8...h6 followed by 9...g5 and 10...Nh5. But
surely the result of the game should not depend on that?} (7... d6 8. Bg5 h6 9.
Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh5) 8. Bg5 O-O 9. e3 {White adopts a restrained setup which is
popular nowadays as well (although usually with the white bishop on f4).
Nevertheless, in only four moves White ends up playing e3-e4 anyway.} 9... d6
10. Nd2 {Preventing the freeing exchange ...Bg4xf3 as well as the
...h6/...g5/... Nh5 idea, while heading for the key c4-square.} 10... h6 11. Bh4
Na6 {This knight development is quite normal in the Benoni, and its adoption
here is particularly logical since ...b6 is usually played by Black in this
setup. Meanwhile, the slow way White has played, with e3 instead of e4, seems to
make the choice of ...Na6 even more logical. But throughout the rest of the game
we constantly see the defect of this position of the knight.} 12. Be2 Nc7 13. e4
{Apparently another loss of a tempo, but White needs to guard d5.} 13... b5
{Apparently Black has achieved his goals in a Benoni. The ...b5 advance has been
made, and additionally White lost a tempo by playing e4 in two moves rather than
one. But it is very hard to understand how Black went wrong in the coming moves
and why he was quickly crushed! To begin with, we can talk about the inclusion
of ...b6 and a3 again. Here the a3 move is helping to prevent a quick ...b4,
while ...b6 turns out to be irrelevent because Black played ...b5 anyway.
Normally Black plays ...b6 in this system with the knight on c7, but usually
only after White plays a2-a4. So in a way it could be claimed that White has
adopted a superior setup by not trying to stop ...b5 and instead using the extra
move a3 afterwards. Well this is all complicated, but ultimately Black's problem
is the misplaced knight on c7 - having achieved ... b5 without opposition, the
knight there has no purpose  and is inactive.} 14. O-O Qd7 {A natural setup,
unpinning the knight and preparing to develop the bishop somewhere on either b7
or a6. Perhaps, though, a case could be made for 14...Bd7, when the bishop
better controls squares like b5 and a4, in preparation for an eventual ...b4
advance.} 15. Qc2 Re8 16. Rfe1 {Petrosian's play is very quiet and only
concerned with restricting his opponent's possibilities and strengthening key
points. Only if Black does nothing will he slowly go over the the attack.} 16...
Bb7 {A move which might be questioned, since the bishop normally has few
prospects here. However, Black needs to connect the rooks and finish
development. It would be nice to play ...a5 and ...Ba6, but the problem is that
the immediate 16...a5 can be met by 17.a4, punching holes in the queenside.}
(16... a5 17. a4 $1 {White will reconquer the c4-square for the knight.}) 17. h3
a6 $6 {Black couldn't find anything positive to do, so he makes this basically
useful move, maintaining the position. It can be said that there is little
difference between this and Petrosian's last move (17.h3). But it turns out that
Black needs to act considerably more hastily. In fact, the 17.h3 move was a
preparation for f2-f4 (white defends against ...Ng4). Here 17...c4 was
recommended, since Larsen played that next move. Another possibility was 17...g5
followed by the doubling of the rooks on the e-file.} (17... c4 {Preparing
...Na6-c5, getting the knight to a good square. But perhaps by} 18. b3 cxb3 19.
Qxb3 {White could maintain some advantage. It is still not easy to activate the
knight on c7, and in the long term d6 will be weak.}) (17... g5 {This creates
some significant weaknesses, but at least it stops f2-f4.} 18. Bg3 Re7 $1 {This
way of playing would have been hard to decide on, and it was also difficult, in
view of White's seemingly leisurely play, to recognize the need for this. But it
might be the best. White can hardly use the weakened f5-square, since for
example 19.Nf1 Rae8 and the threats on the e-file come first. And if 20.f3 then
20...Nh5, et cetera.}) 18. f4 {It had seemed that White placed little emphasis
on the central breakthrough in his previous moves. But with surprising speed
Black finds himself doing contortions to prevent e4-e5. It turns out that
Petrosian has just put his pieces on the right squares, while some of Larsen's
are misplaced.} 18... c4 19. Bf3 h5 {Black needs to be ready for ... Nh7 in
order to allow the bishop to control e5, so he must prevent Bg4 in response.}
20. Rad1 Nh7 21. e5 $1 {Although Black has control of e5, White is able to make
this breakthrough anyway. It is very unusual how White's quiet play has led to a
position where the fierce breakthrough is decisive.} 21... dxe5 22. Nde4 {The
point. Nc5 followed by capturing the Bb7 and then d5-d5 is threatened, and Black
finds it very difficult to prevent this. In the meantime, White is also aiming
at f6.} 22... Qf5 {Black tries to be more active, but this just multiplies his
problems. Necessary was 22...Bf8, although the position after 23.d6 Ne6 24.fxe5
is hardly pretty.} (22... Bf8 23. d6 Ne6 24. fxe5) 23. Qf2 $1 {A crushing move.

a commital move like 5.Bg5 (which could be met by 5...Be7 and an eventual

alternative lines when the bishop is left on c8 for the time being.} 6. cxd5

not want to be left with a blocked pawn on d5 after 6...exd5. The resulting
central structure, typical of the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit
Declined, would allow White to use an alternative development and emphasize the
weakness on the c-file.} (6... exd5 7. g3 {Some other moves are possible. But
this position differs from the Exchange Variation in a variety of ways. White's
bishop is not on g5, so Black will not have ...Ne4 with a freeing exchange. The
light bishop will go to g2, so Black will have less counterplay against the
king. And White will have pressure on the c-file. Black can more easily play
...c5, but this leads to hanging pawns, for which purpose the bishop on g2 is
well suited. Another move is 7.b4.}) 7. e3 {White slowly builds up power in the
center. The advance e3-e4 will eventually come, and the position will start to
look like a Gruenfeld, with White gaining attacking chances on the kingside.}
7... Be7 8. Bb5+ {White inserts this check to induce ...c6, blocking the bishop
on b7, at least temporarily.} 8... c6 9. Bd3 c5 $6 {Smyslov goes to make this
freeing advance right away. However, nowadays Black would first develop with
...0-0 and maybe ...Nd7. Petrosian shows that, contrary to appearances, it is
risky to open the game so soon.} 10. Nxd5 Qxd5 {Of course Black could play
10...exd5, leading to the structure discussed before. However, in such positions
the exchange of a pair of minor pieces can only help White, so it would not be
so logical.} 11. dxc5 Qxc5 {Black looks active, and even if the queen has to
move again, it doesn't seem like it could be such a big problem. But Petrosian
shows that there are indeed some problems. Meanwhile, if 11...Bxc5 then 12.e4
blots out the light squared bishop and leads to an ideal development for White.}
(11... Bxc5 12. e4 Qd8 13. b4 Bd6 14. O-O {At the right moment White can play
e4-e5.}) 12. Bd2 Nc6 $6 {After this move Black starts to experience some real
problems. Probably Smyslov avoided the natural 12...0-0 because of 13.Bb4, but
it doesn't look so dangerous after 13...Qc7. Instead Black finds his queen more
exposed, while the knight is also not on the best square.} (12... O-O 13. Bb4
Qc7 14. O-O {Perhaps White has some small advantage here of slightly more active
pieces. If Black captures on b4 White might have a chance to cramp the queenside
with b4-b5. But still it doesn't seem so bad for Black.}) 13. Rc1 Qd6 {The queen
couldn't go to h5, since already 14.Qa4 wins material due to the pin.} 14. Qc2
{Another tempo is gained - Black will have to play ...h6 in order to castle.}
14... Rc8 15. O-O h6 {Discoveries with the knight don't work due to checks by
the bishop on b5 or the queen on a4.} (15... Ne5 16. Bb5+) 16. Rfd1 {Black finds
himself suddenly behind in development - through little pinpricks Petrosian has
succeeded in gaining numerous tempi.} 16... O-O 17. Bc3 Qb8 {Black has managed
finally to hide his queen, but now she is buried, far from the kingside,
allowing Petrosian to begin threats there.} (17... Qc7 18. Be5) 18. Qa4 $1 {A
nice way of activating the queen, which is heading towards the kingside.} 18...
Rfd8 {Black prepares to meet 19.Qg4 with 19...Bf8.} 19. Qe4 {This forcing of
more weaknesses was inevitable. With repeated threats, Petrosian tempts the
kingside pawns forward.} 19... g6 20. Qg4 {Now the sacrifice 21.Bxg6 is
threatened.} 20... h5 21. Qh3 {The main threat is g4, but Bxg6 is also still on
the table.} 21... f5 {Stopping both threats, but creating a fatal weakness on
e6.} 22. Bc4 Rxd1+ 23. Rxd1 Kf7 24. e4 $1 {White begins dismantling the
edifice.} 24... Qf4 25. Re1 {The attack is well calculated - Black seemingly can
force an exchange of queens by 25...Qg4, but in fact White will force him to
leave the queens on the board and accept a deadly piece sacrifice.} 25... Qg4
26. exf5 $1 Qxc4 {Completing the queen exchange by 26...Qxh3 would fail to the
Zwischenschach 27.Bxe6+.} (26... Qxh3 27. Bxe6+ Kf8 28. gxh3 {White didn't just
win two pawns, but the attack continues - the rook is threatened on c8 as well
as 29.fxg6 followed by g7+, et cetera.}) 27. fxg6+ Ke8 (27... Kxg6 28. Rxe6+ Kf7

methods are used with about equal frequency.} 11. f3 $6 {This move, however, is
less justified with the knight on d7 than on a6. Compared to that line, here
Black is aiming for play on the kingside, with moves like ...Ne5 and ...Nh5. The
move f3 only hurts White.} 11... a6 12. a4 Qc7 13. Qb3 $2 {White goes to prevent

somewhat drafty White king, but the rook will also take part on the b-file and
drive the white king away from the defense.} 20. axb6 Rxb6 21. Qa2 {21.Qa3 was
