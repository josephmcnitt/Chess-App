# Chess-App
Okay, my next step is to complete the chess.py file to be able to play through a game, and especially to play through and get the FEN at any given time. 

I'll also need to try and figure out how to deal with sublines... That will be an important question. So for this, probably the best will be getting an "import_pgn" function into create_fen_file probably. Let's see if ChatGPT has an idea.
