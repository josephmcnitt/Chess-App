move in this structure - if White can carry it out in the right circumstances,
he can get a won game. The pawn clamps down on d6 and b6, while also freeing c4
for the white pieces and opening the line of the light-squared bishop.

chance to force a very favorable ending. However, after 14...Bf8 15.Na4 Black
would be unable to develop the pieces and would be doomed to passivity.

is that it fails to place maximum pressure on the important d5-square, and it
also doesn't do anything for the eventual freedom of white's Rooks. Far more
common is 2.c4 (gaining central and queenside space) when 3.Nc3 will join with
the c4-pawn to pressure d5, while also setting up situations where &amp;ndash;
if Black plays ...d7-d5 at some point &amp;ndash; White will chop on d5 (cxd5)
and open up the c-file for his Rooks. Nevertheless, 2.Nc3 has its supporters
&amp;ndash; the early Knight move forces black's hand (...d7-d5), otherwise
White will play e2-e4 and grab the center. This often leads to sharp, unusual
play, and can easily take Black out of all his opening preparation.

removes black's Bishop pair and, by simplifying, takes away any dynamism that
might have remained in the black position. My old friend grandmaster Nigel
Davies (we shared some interesting adventures in the jungles of Brazil
&amp;ndash; these included an attack on the Mayor's house, me pretending to be a
cop and demanding entrance [by kicking in a door] to a well known grandmaster's
hotel room, an insane Hitler mime that kept sneaking up on the players and
freaking everyone out, and a stampede of coatimundis at Iguazu Falls), in his
book, THE VERESOV (2003), had this to say: \"Black's best plan is to retreat his
Bishop from f5 to e6, play ...f6-f5, and then bring his Knight from b8-e4 via d7
and f6.\"
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/3p4/3P4/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: The fact is this position is a little better for White, with
the caveat that Black's ideal result is a draw, while White will be pushing for
more throughout the game. In other words, it's an ideal grandmaster opening that
offers White chances to win, and few chances to lose. Why is this the case? The
pawn structure answers that question: white's structure is devoid of weaknesses
and offers two key pawn breaks &amp;ndash; c2-c4 or e3-e4. Black's structure is
less flexible and lacks the same type of fluid breaks since ...c6-c5 would leave
d5 weak, and ...f6-f5-f4 is very difficult to achieve. Other than these basic
positional ideas, if Black castles short, White can also go for the kingside
nuke option via g2-g4, h2-h4, etc. Thus, for the most part black's position is
passive, and he'll usually just hold tight and hope to earn that half a point.

FEN: rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/3p4/3PP3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 8; Commentary: This move, which scores very well for White, seeks to
create a favorable pawn structure in one of two ways: 1) Black will leave the
pawn on e4 and let White take on d5. The resulting isolated pawn on d5 will
prove rather weak; 2) Black will capture on e4, which will result in positions
where White is half a pawn ahead (black's crippled kingside majority won't be
able to create a passed pawn in most endgames). In this 2nd scenario, Black
isn't badly placed, but he will face a long, thankless defensive task. And, as I
said earlier, if black's successful, he'll get no more than a draw.

identical to positions Ulf Andersson got in the 70s. In fact, the Black side of
this structure was his bread and butter and he rarely lost against world-class
opposition! If you or anyone else wants to play this line vs. the Verasov, you
need to make a detailed study of that structure and then you can enter these
lines with confidence. Actually, this is how you should study all openings:
master the pawn structures, understand the pros and cons of those structures,
and only then memorize some moves (they will make a lot more sense after you
\"grok\" the structures).

an eye on two important squares (c5 and e5) so I'm not sure White should rush to
make this swap. In fact, Black would eventually try and trade off that pawn
himself via ...c6-c5. On the other hand, Mr. Andersson has shown us that this
position (with or without d4-d5) isn't a big deal for White, as long as Black
understands the nuances of this structure.

some mistakes to lose the game, so he doesn't rush &ndash; instead he quietly
builds his position, seeks ideal positions for his Knights, and hopes Black
cracks due to the strain of having to constantly defend. As you can see, the
experienced (and strong) player knows very well that one-move threats literally
force the opponent to be on his guard, and that the resulting heightened sense
of danger usually results in good moves. Thus, instead of forcing the issue,
White patiently keeps improving his position and follows this classic old rule:
\"When it doubt, let the opponent get an idea, it&rsquo;s bound to be wrong.\"

Black will experience severe difficulties after 29...Bg3 (though computers think
that Black is fine, a very deep analysis will show that, at least for humans,
this isn't the case). In fact, for all intents and purposes, one can say that
this is the decisive mistake because, even though I think the game can still be
saved, the defense is so difficult that many players (even masters) would go
down in flames.

FEN: rr6/1bp2k2/p1p3p1/R1PpPpRp/1P1K1P1P/8/P3B1P1/8 w - - 18 37; Commentary: This loses
immediately. Black had to walk the tightrope with some move like 36... Rhg8,
standing ready to defend the kingside or queenside at a moment's notice.
However, White can switch between attacks on the a6- and g6- pawns very rapidly,
combined with Zugzwang motifs and even some breakthroughs such as b4-b5 or g2-g4
combined with h4-h5, if need be - so Black should not be able to defend.

sacrifice a piece. Instead 14...Ba6 15.bxc7 would be risky - Black's dark
squares, such as d6, would become very weak, and the c7-pawn remains as a
threat. Alternatively he could try 14...Bxa3, which might be best.

absolutlely crucial. Now the knight on g7 might turn out to be poor for some
timel, while White can still open lines with h2-h4. Although it would seem that
Black can defend the one open file, it is not so easy in practice. White also
has the f5 square to use and prospects of an invasion on the queenside. All in
all, Black faces a thankless defense.

position would favor Black's two knights against White's bishops. However, both
knights are passive and have no reasonable route to a good square. Meanwhile,
White's dark-squared bishop has reasonable prospects on the kingside, while it
is also hard for Black to defend squares like b5 and c6.

10.Bxd7+ followed by 11.Ne2. But later he came to the conclusion that 9.Bd3
could be played, meeting 9...Qa5 with a promising pawn sacrifice 10.Ne2 Nxd5
11.0-0. This became the main line.

Black transforms the game into a Benoni with the inclusion of a3 and ...b6.
There are indeed quite a few lines of the Benoni where ...b6 is a useful move,
while White usually ends up playing a4, not a3. Nevetheless, White can try to
aim for lines where this difference is not relevent, and also try to show that
even an improved Benoni is still not good enough...

here is particularly logical since ...b6 is usually played by Black in this
setup. Meanwhile, the slow way White has played, with e3 instead of e4, seems to
make the choice of ...Na6 even more logical. But throughout the rest of the game
we constantly see the defect of this position of the knight.

FEN: r1bq1rk1/p1n2pb1/3p1npp/1ppP4/4P2B/P1N5/1P1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 14; Commentary: Apparently Black has achieved his goals in a Benoni. The ...b5 advance has been
made, and additionally White lost a tempo by playing e4 in two moves rather than
one. But it is very hard to understand how Black went wrong in the coming moves
and why he was quickly crushed! To begin with, we can talk about the inclusion
of ...b6 and a3 again. Here the a3 move is helping to prevent a quick ...b4,
while ...b6 turns out to be irrelevent because Black played ...b5 anyway.
Normally Black plays ...b6 in this system with the knight on c7, but usually
only after White plays a2-a4. So in a way it could be claimed that White has
adopted a superior setup by not trying to stop ...b5 and instead using the extra
move a3 afterwards. Well this is all complicated, but ultimately Black's problem
is the misplaced knight on c7 - having achieved ... b5 without opposition, the
knight there has no purpose  and is inactive.

unpinning the knight and preparing to develop the bishop somewhere on either b7
or a6. Perhaps, though, a case could be made for 14...Bd7, when the bishop
better controls squares like b5 and a4, in preparation for an eventual ...b4
advance.

prospects here. However, Black needs to connect the rooks and finish
development. It would be nice to play ...a5 and ...Ba6, but the problem is that
the immediate 16...a5 can be met by 17.a4, punching holes in the queenside.

useful move, maintaining the position. It can be said that there is little
difference between this and Petrosian's last move (17.h3). But it turns out that
Black needs to act considerably more hastily. In fact, the 17.h3 move was a
preparation for f2-f4 (white defends against ...Ng4). Here 17...c4 was
recommended, since Larsen played that next move. Another possibility was 17...g5
followed by the doubling of the rooks on the e-file.

on the central breakthrough in his previous moves. But with surprising speed
Black finds himself doing contortions to prevent e4-e5. It turns out that
Petrosian has just put his pieces on the right squares, while some of Larsen's
are misplaced.

FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5; Commentary: Of course, Black could have played 4..
.Bb4, but perhaps he did not want to play this line of the Nimzo-Indian (with .
..b6)? Now, however, if White plays 5.g3 then 5...Bb4 is a good line.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5; Commentary: Petrosian plays his trademark move, just preventing ...Bb4, rather than making
a commital move like 5.Bg5 (which could be met by 5...Be7 and an eventual
...Ne4).
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6; Commentary: This move is most logical when Black has already played
...Bb7. If White had played a3 on move four then Black would have a variety of
alternative lines when the bishop is left on c8 for the time being.

FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: This is still one of the main lines of the Petrosian Variation. Black does
not want to be left with a blocked pawn on d5 after 6...exd5. The resulting
central structure, typical of the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit
Declined, would allow White to use an alternative development and emphasize the
weakness on the c-file.
FEN: rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7; Commentary: White slowly builds up power in the
center. The advance e3-e4 will eventually come, and the position will start to
look like a Gruenfeld, with White gaining attacking chances on the kingside.

freeing advance right away. However, nowadays Black would first develop with
...0-0 and maybe ...Nd7. Petrosian shows that, contrary to appearances, it is
risky to open the game so soon.

10...exd5, leading to the structure discussed before. However, in such positions
the exchange of a pair of minor pieces can only help White, so it would not be
so logical.

FEN: rn2k2r/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2q5/8/P2BPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12; Commentary: Black looks active, and even if the queen has to
move again, it doesn't seem like it could be such a big problem. But Petrosian
shows that there are indeed some problems. Meanwhile, if 11...Bxc5 then 12.e4
blots out the light squared bishop and leads to an ideal development for White.

FEN: r3k2r/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2q5/8/P2BPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 13; Commentary: After this move Black starts to experience some real
problems. Probably Smyslov avoided the natural 12...0-0 because of 13.Bb4, but
it doesn't look so dangerous after 13...Qc7. Instead Black finds his queen more
exposed, while the knight is also not on the best square.

somewhat drafty White king, but the rook will also take part on the b-file and
drive the white king away from the defense.

become one of the critical lines against the Benoni. The basic plan of attack is
demonstrated in this game. The knight goes to the g3 square, where it seems to

FEN: r3r1k1/pp3pbp/3q2p1/2p5/4B3/8/PP3PPP/RQ3RK1 w - - 0 19; Commentary: Ultimately
this position is hopeless. Not only is Black up a pawn, but he has the excellent
support point for the bishop on d4, with pressure on both sides of the board.
The presence of opposite colored bishops will not save White.

this position is not one where they are particularly valuable. Although it is

without Black's pieces developing great activity.

FEN: rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/PBN5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9; Commentary: This slow move, and the two that
follow, cannot really be recommended for white. The f3-e4 structure is in
general too slow (if it isn't and English Attack) when white has castled short.
This game is an example of black using the Queenside Minority Attack, and using
timely maneuvers (Ne5-c4, Bf8-g6-Bg7, etc) to slowly improve the position. White
makes no real effort to challenge the Scheveningen structure via normal plans,
and is outplayed.

development makes total sense here. White has no real chances to play on the
Kingside anymore and bringing the knight to c5 isn't as effective with white's
over defense of the e4 pawn.
